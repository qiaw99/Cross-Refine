0,Can masks reduce corona infections when worn by a large proportion of the population?,"Studies show slow spread After three years of pandemic, there are now relatively meaningful data that masks can slow down the spread of the Corona virus. Surgical masks, in turn, seem to reduce the risk of infecting themselves with the corona virus.",yes,"International studies suggest that the number of corona infections decreases when many people wear masks - whether fabric, surgical or FFP2 masks. However, it is not possible to precisely quantify how great the protective effect actually is. It probably depends on the type of masks and the proportion of people who wear them."
1,Can homeopathic preparations with Anamirta cocculus help against dizziness?,"But without success: We could not find any meaningful scientific evidence for effectiveness in dizziness. It is now well proven by studies that homeopathic preparations usually do not work better than a sham medication (placebo) [8]. However, it is not well established that betahistine is effective against dizziness [11.13]. The fact that betahist helps with dizziness is not well documented [11, 13].",unknown,"We have found only one study that has investigated this. However, it is so poor that no reliable statement is possible."
2,Can zeolite alleviate or prevent health problems?,"However, none of these can provide any evidence – because the studies have no significance (for reasons see section Studies in detail ). It does not find an advantage for zeolite – but the results are hardly meaningful. However, it is not researched whether the regular intake of zeolite can lead to a nutrient deficiency or has an undesirable effect on digestion.",unknown,Studies to date cannot provide any evidence that taking zeolite prevents or alleviates complaints. A detoxifying effect is not scientifically plausible.
3,Does paxlovid protect unvaccinated people with risk factors from severe or even fatal covid 19 disease?,"Patients at risk without corona vaccination appear to be well protected from serious to fatal events by Paxlovid. However, it is not certain how well Paxlovid helps people who have already received corona vaccination. In addition, the scientists investigated whether Paxlovid alleviated the Covid-19 symptoms, shortened the duration of the disease and reduced the need for medical treatment: Half of the participants improved the symptoms with Paxlovid after 13 days, with placebo after 15 days. With Paxlovid, 14 out of 1000 participants needed medical treatment for Covid-19 within a month, with placebo 76 out of 1000. Whether with or without antibodies in the blood, Paxlovid basically protected all humans from a severe course.",yes,"In a large, well-done study, paxlovid prevented hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. They were unvaccinated and had contracted the delta variant. For vaccinated people, the benefit cannot be reliably estimated. This also applies to people with immunodeficiency."
4,"Does starting school later improve health, learning success, and quality of life in adolescents?","However, teenagers and parents now have to be very strong: despite 27 studies involving hundreds of thousands of students, no clear results can be derived from research. The problem: The studies usually come to contradictory results. So until better research results are available, all troubled young people and parents will only have the option of remaining out of bed early – or to hope that, despite lack of evidence, the school management will still have an insight into it. It is difficult to examine whether a later start to school will have a positive effect. The Problems: Unknown Influencing Factors: If differences occur in previous-after-studies, these do not have to be due to the later start of school – they may also have been caused by other changes over the course of the study period.",unknown,"The question has been investigated in several large studies. Due to methodological deficiencies and contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This means that science can currently neither speak for nor against a benefit of a later school start."
5,Does the F.X. Mayr cure have health benefits? Can it prevent diseases or treat them?,"Thus, the claim that the method can help with various diseases is not scientifically justified. These studies cannot answer whether these changes also affect health. Mayr cure or other fasting methods improve health in the long term, however, cannot be concluded.",unknown,"It is neither examined nor proven whether the special fasting method after F.X. Mayr holds, which it promises: Namely assistance with all possible illnesses of allergies, over rheumatism up to sleep disturbances. The advertised detoxification and ""purification"" of the body by the chamfering cure are besides scientifically not plausible."
6,Does the consumption of soy foods or soy isoflavones affect the appearance of acne skin?,"In both cases, certain soya ingredients are responsible for the effect on the skin: the isoflavones. There are two competing theories that contradict each other: according to the first theory, isoflavones confuse the hormone balance and are supposed to promote acne in this way. Surprisingly, despite searching in two large databases, we could not find a study on soy products and acne – whether soy milk, soy sauce or tofu. The isoflavones improved the skin appearance more than an anti-acne cream with vitamin A acid (Tretinoin). Conclusion: There is currently no evidence from reliable studies that soy makes acne worse.",unknown,"We could not find any meaningful studies at all on the influence of soy foods on acne. On soy isoflavones, we found two small studies of questionable quality that examined a very specific group of sufferers. Soy isoflavones improved the skin appearance somewhat. However, this result is not reliable."
7,Does extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) help with erectile dysfunction?,Efficacy does not appear to have been studied or demonstrated. The studies in detail We could not find any studies on Damiana extract against erectile dysfunction in men. Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.,unknown,"The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
8,Is the homeopathic remedy Neradin effective for erectile dysfunction?,No studies on Neradin Also our search for studies on the product Neradin remained resultless. Studies on the product Neradin also appear to be missing.,unknown,"The extract from the Damiana plant (Turnera diffusa) is advertised as a remedy for erectile dysfunction for men. However, this claimed effect on potency is by no means proven. It has apparently never been tested on humans. This also applies to homeopathic remedies such as the product Neradin."
9,Does regular HPV testing in addition to the recommended Pap smear detect more precancerous lesions than just the Pap smear alone?,"According to the studies, the HPV test is likely to detect slightly more precursors of cervical cancer over several years than the PAP swab alone. We are therefore relatively sure that with an additional HPV test at least a little more precursors of uterine cancer are detected than only with the PAP swab alone.",yes,"Regular examination of the cervix by means of PAP smear tests detects precancerous stages of the cervix in most cases in good time. This reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer. An additional HPV test every three to five years can make screening even more reliable. However, the difference should not be too great."
10,Can monk's pepper reduce PMS symptoms? PMS is the abbreviation for premenstrual syndrome. This refers to complaints that occur in the days before menstruation.,"Reference to efficacy in PMS According to previous studies, monk peppers could actually help in PMS. The summarized study results indicate that the symptoms with monk pepper are reduced in more patients than with a sham medication (placebo). Therefore, it would be possible for monk peppers to act against PMS symptoms such as breast spacing.",yes,"In the studies to date, monk's pepper seems to relieve PMS symptoms better than a placebo. However, this is not well proven, because the studies have significant weaknesses. There is no evidence of an effect on menstrual disorders. Significant studies are lacking."
11,Can olive leaf extract reduce high blood pressure?,"These studies therefore do not indicate whether olive leaf extract can help with significantly increased blood pressure. Without success, however, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on cardiovascular health. However, they cannot provide clear answers. It is therefore impossible to say whether olive leaves extract could have a better or worse effect with significantly increased blood pressure.",unknown,"Whether olive leaf extract lowers blood pressure has been investigated in five suitable studies to date. They all found no effect or only a slight effect of the extract. The problem with this is that most of the study participants had only slightly elevated blood pressure. They cannot answer how olive leaf extract works in people with significantly elevated blood pressure (hypertension). The studies also had gross flaws, few participants, and ran for a very short time. They cannot provide reliable answers."
12,Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?,"Studies overall not meaningful The conclusion of our research: Scientific evidence for the claimed effect is missing. It is also unclear whether the measured positive effects are large enough to actually be felt by those affected. Whether or not green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis cannot be said at the moment. However, as early as 2009, the European Food Safety Authority considered that a protective effect of the green-lipped mussel on healthy joints has not been established. In our opinion, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from the studies found.",unknown,"The question was examined in four small studies with serious methodological deficiencies, which also arrived at partly contradictory results. No clear conclusions can be drawn from them. The claim that green-lipped mussel helps with osteoarthritis is not scientifically proven."
13,Can probiotics lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetes?,"And if so, can probiotics reverse this change and reduce blood sugar levels again? At the most small effect, they may actually be able to. However, the effect of the capsules and tablets does not seem to be large: in the previous studies, they were able to reduce the long-term sugar level HbA1c by an average of 0.55 points.",yes,"The summarized results of studies to date suggest that probiotics in capsule or tablet form could lower blood sugar somewhat. At least if they are taken over a period of two to three months. However, the effect is not well established. Probiotic dairy products and probiotic powder for dissolving do not seem to have any demonstrable effect."
14,Can the so-called Tupler technique help against rectus diastasis?,"No studies on the Tupler technique As intense as we were looking for, we could not find the promised studies on the Tupler technique. The claim that this is a scientifically proven therapy for rectus diastase is therefore simply wrong. The studies in detail We did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of the Tupler technique for the treatment of rectus diastase.",unknown,We could not find a single study that examined whether the Tupler technique actually works. And this despite the fact that providers of the method advertise that its effectiveness is scientifically proven.
15,Can CBD (cannabidiol) help with migraines or other headaches?,"Apparently, CBD has never been investigated to see if it can help with migraine seizures. The claim that CBD would help with migraines or headaches is pure speculation. The studies in detail Despite extensive search in three databases, we could not find any studies on CBD against migraine or other types of headache, neither for treatment nor for prevention.",unknown,There are no studies that have investigated the effectiveness of CBD against migraine. So claims that CBD can help with or prevent migraine attacks have no scientific basis. The same is true for other types of headache.
16,Can laser irradiation of blood by infusion needle (hemolaser treatment) relieve discomfort or help with diseases?,"It is also unclear by what mechanism blood irradiation with bundled red light – i.e. red laser – should improve health. Although the authors of the three studies found [1-3] claim to have established a clear efficacy of haemolaser treatment, none of the three studies is suitable to prove this.",unknown,There is no scientific evidence that hemolaser treatment has a palliative or curative effect on health problems.
17,"In everyday life, when breathing with an FFP2 mask or ordinary mouth-nose protection, do you get as much oxygen as without a mask?","As much oxygen as without a mask This fear is, however, unfounded, as previously conducted studies show [ 1,2 ]. Only in very strenuous sports (fast cycling to exhaustion) was the oxygen content in the blood with FFP2 mask slightly lower than without mask. There was no difference in oxygen measurement with ordinary oral nose protection. Breathing a little more strenuous The results thus contradict the rumor that masks would cause an oxygen deficiency.",yes,"Even if breathing with a mask can feel uncomfortable: According to studies to date, you get just as much oxygen with an FFP2 mask or mouth-nose protection as without a mask. This is true even when you are moving or exerting yourself. Only very intensive sports slightly reduce the oxygen content in the blood - but too little to endanger health."
18,Can CBD help with period pain?,"Because despite searching in three different databases we could not find a single study on CBD in case of regular pain. Scientifically, it is not sufficiently researched whether CBD actually promotes sleep, as providers claim. The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether CBD can help with normal pain – neither for treatment nor for prevention.",unknown,Whether CBD can relieve menstrual pain has apparently never been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. Women who suffer from severe period pain should talk to a gynecologist about it. Diseases such as endometriosis could be behind it.
19,"Can a bioresonance device like ""Bioscan"" or ""Vieva Vital Analyser"" measure mineral and vitamin deficiencies or detect health problems?","This experiment clearly shows that the devices studied are completely unsuitable to diagnose a lack of vitamins or minerals. Sentenced for fraud at the end of May 2022, a German court also concluded that the Bioscan device cannot fulfil the claimed claims. Claims for comparable products are equally implausible. Even if 1000 subjects had participated in the study and only five to six people had shown such unreliable readings, such a device would be worthless for diagnostics.",no,"An experiment shows that the devices cannot distinguish between healthy people, seriously ill people and a corpse. The claimed mode of action behind the measurement method is also scientifically implausible. A German court has convicted the manufacturers of the Bioscan device (not legally binding) of fraud."
20,Does arthroscopy (joint endoscopy) help with osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"What might sound logical, however, has a catch: the arthroscopy of osteoarthritis does nothing to the treated person. Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis. In these studies, patients treated after arthroscopy had no noticeably less pain or movement restrictions than those treated only for appearance or not at all. Arthroscopy against osteoarthritis: not effective, but also not very risky After all: Undesirable events were not conspicuously common in the arthroscopy groups either.",no,The data are clear: Arthroscopy is useless as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. It can neither relieve pain nor improve the function of the knee joint in the long term.
21,"Do dietary supplements containing silicon (e.g. as ""organic silicon"" or silica) have health benefits?","So far it is also completely unclear what role the element silicon plays in the human body at all [8]. We have researched: Previous studies do not provide any evidence that dietary supplements with silicon support bone build-up and thus protect older women from osteoporosis and bone fractures in old age [1,2]. There is no evidence that silicon improves the hair structure [3,4], strengthens the fingernails [4] or makes the skin more beautiful and elastic [4,6,7]. Also that silicon supports the formation of collagen and connective tissue is only a conjecture [8]. Conjectures without studies Neither we nor the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [8] were able to find clinical studies on any other alleged health benefits of silicon.",unknown,"There is no evidence so far that the additional intake of silicon can promote health. Also that it strengthens nails, skin and hair is an unsubstantiated claim. Moreover, it is unclear whether silicon plays any role at all in the body."
22,Can regular intake of cranberry juice or cranberry extract prevent recurrent cystitis in women?,"The summarized results show that the regular intake of cranberry products could have a preventive effect. There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women. Overall, there is evidence of a possible preventive effect of cranberry.",yes,"Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
23,Will women who have recurrent bladder infections get rid of them faster if they take cranberry products only after the disease is already there???,"There is also only evidence that cranberry products can prevent bladder inflammation for otherwise healthy women. However, there does not seem to be any meaningful studies that have investigated this in women with recurrent bladder inflammation. The preventive effect of cranberry in children, men and people with urinary catheters or certain diseases has not been studied.",unknown,"Women who repeatedly have to deal with bladder infections might become ill somewhat less frequently if they regularly take cranberry juice or extract. However, this is not well established. And it only applies to uncomplicated bladder infections in otherwise healthy women. Whether cranberry products help when cystitis is already present remains unclear. This has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
24,Can extract from St. John's wort relieve the symptoms of depression? Is it similarly effective as drugs against depression (antidepressants)?,"St John's wort: effective in mild to moderate depression Probably yes. In mild to moderate depression, St John's wort preparations probably work better than placebo. St John's wort preparations are probably as good as antidepressants. St. John's wort and antidepressants can relieve the discomfort, but the depression can probably not cure for good.",yes,St. John's wort is likely to relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate depression better than a placebo. It also appears to be similarly effective to approved medications for depression (antidepressants). St. John's wort preparations are generally better tolerated than antidepressants.
25,"Does the Zisano bracelet strengthen the immune system, increase endurance and performance or reduce fatigue?","Whether such bracelets have an effect, for example whether they can actually increase physical performance or strengthen the immune system, has apparently never been investigated. Bracelets for more performance: studies show ineffectiveness All five studies came to the same conclusion: the bracelets had no effect on the performance or well-being of the subjects. A scientifically plausible explanation as to how exactly such bracelets should develop their effect remains to be found in their suppliers. The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the Zisano bracelet or comparable bracelets with silicon chip.",unknown,"The promised positive effects of the ""Powerband"" wristband on health and well-being have apparently not been scientifically studied. We could not find any studies on this. It is also unclear how the wristband is supposed to work in concrete terms. A scientifically plausible explanation is missing."
26,"Does microimmunotherapy improve symptoms of allergies, cancer, joint inflammation, autoimmune diseases, dementia or various viral infections?","None of these studies are meaningful – because they are poorly carried out and the published data are incomplete. They cannot give any indication of the benefits of microimmune therapy. Entitled doubts Since microimmune therapy preparations are highly diluted as homeopathic agents, we have fundamental doubts about the method.",unknown,"So far, studies seem to exist only on microimmunotherapy against hay fever and cancer. Their significance is far too low to conclude that the therapy is effective. We found no studies on other health problems. Thus, there is no proven benefit of microimmunotherapy for any disease."
27,Can ginkgo extract improve mental performance in dementia patients?,"Dementia patients taking Ginkgo extract often seemed to perform better in thinking, memory, and concentration tasks than those who swallowed placebo preparations without an active substance [1.3]. Although the studies indicate that Ginkgo extract can help people with dementia, the significance of the individual studies is limited.",yes,Previous studies suggest that ginkgo extract can improve mental performance in dementia - but this is not well established. It is not possible to say exactly how large this effect is.
28,Does pine wood improve sleep?,"So there is no indication that the pine wood improves sleep. The importance of these laboratory measurements for the sleep of the participants is unclear – even if the researchers interpret them as positive effects of the circling bed. Whether a pine bed actually improves sleep would have to study more rigorous studies carried out according to scientific criteria on significantly more subjects in the future.The studies in detail [1,2] Grote et al.",unknown,"So far, only one small study has investigated this question. However, the results of this study are not conclusive due to numerous deficiencies in the conduct of the study."
29,Do spermidine supplements or a spermidine-rich diet reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia? Do they help with existing dementia?,"Spermidin studies: not enough as evidence of efficacy Even if both studies had come to overwhelmingly positive results, we would still have concerns about their significance. Spermidine, which is additionally absorbed by food, is not sufficiently researched at the present time. The number of participants is low and the risk is high that the results are not transferable to reality. We do not consider the study to be meaningful. Results: Both the spermidine group and the comparator group had fewer dementia symptoms and better mental performance at the end of the study.",unknown,"Manufacturers of spermidine drugs advertise an alleged positive effect on mental performance and protection against dementia. However, such an effect has not been proven in meaningful studies. We found a single study in which dementia patients had participated. However, their results are not very clear."
30,Do green-lipped mussel preparations improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"For us, therefore, this claim is not credible. Whether green-lipped mussel helps with rheumatism or not, can therefore not be said for sure at the moment. Whether the results can be transferred to other products or other dosages is unclear. The studies are all badly done according to today's standard: so it is unclear how reliable the measurements of the treatment success are. Whether rheumatism patients would still benefit from green-lipped mussel preparations remains unclear.",unknown,"Five small studies provide no overall evidence of benefit from green-lipped mussel in rheumatism. However, the rheumatism treatment of the participants does not meet today's standards and the studies were very poorly conducted. Therefore, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions from these studies."
31,Does covid vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting long-lasting symptoms (long covid) in case of corona infection?,"Long-Covid risk with low vaccination Two studies [1,2] suggest that the long-covid risk is likely to be lower if vaccinated twice: In one of these studies with Corona infected [1], twice vaccinated patients reported 40 to 50 percent less likely to be affected by Long Covid compared to non-vaccinated patients. Results Two-fold Vaccinated people reported to be affected by long-covid symptoms only about half as often as non-vaccinated people.",yes,"If twice-vaccinated people are infected, their risk of later being affected by Long Covid may be only half that of non-vaccinated people. Since there is no clear definition of long covid, the protective effect cannot be precisely quantified."
32,Can the preventive intake of lysine prevent cold sores (lip herpes) and genital herpes? Can lysine help when the blisters are already there?,"You cannot answer whether preventively taken lysine can prevent herpes, or whether it helps if the blisters are already there. So the lysine didn't seem to have any effect. Does a higher dose of lysine work better than a lower dose? Results Overall, the participants had no less frequent herpes, whether they were taking high-dose lysine, low-dose lysine or placebo. Results The results are ambiguous and do not allow for certain conclusions: both the Lysin group and the placebo group were less likely to have lip herpes after 6 months.",unknown,Research is coming up with inconclusive and contradictory results. All available studies are small and of unclear quality. We could not say whether lysine protects against herpes or can alleviate it.
33,"Do hormonal contraceptives to swallow (the ""pill"") affect endurance performance in women?","The conclusion of the work: Women taking the pill could actually have a minor disadvantage in sports. Specifically, women with a pill may absorb less oxygen during training and are out of breath faster. Possibly a slightly lower performance through the pill – to this conclusion also came another current overview work [2].",yes,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
34,Does the pill affect the muscle strength of women??,Does the pill also affect muscle strength? The available studies do not provide any indication of such an effect.,no,"Taking the pill could possibly impair endurance performance in sports somewhat. However, there are no indications of less muscle strength due to the pill. However, these - somewhat contradictory - findings are anything but certain. Whether the somewhat reduced endurance performance speaks against contraception with the pill, each athlete must decide for herself - depending on how important top athletic performance is for her."
35,Does whole-body cryotherapy in the cold chamber improve health?,"Moreover, they cannot ensure that alleged improvements are really due to the cold chamber. Based on these data, it is impossible to assess whether whole-body cooling therapy is effective and useful in different health problems. However, none of the studies can prove the effectiveness of the cold chamber treatment, because everyone lacks meaningfulness.",unknown,"Studies published so far are of low quality and therefore not conclusive. The effectiveness of the cold chamber has not been proven for either physical or psychological complaints. There is also no evidence of effectiveness in sports, for example for sore muscles or for a hoped-for increase in athletic performance."
36,Does transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) improve mental performance in people with Alzheimer's dementia? Can the treatment improve the quality of life of those affected?,"Therefore, we do not consider the study results to be meaningful. Transcranial pulse stimulation: not recognized as Alzheimer's therapy Even if providers of transcranial pulse stimulation claim otherwise: as therapy, the treatment with ultrasound in dementia is neither researched nor recognized. There are currently no studies that can prove that it can help people with dementia in the short term or in the long term. None of the studies can answer whether transcranial pulse stimulation or similar procedures help people with dementia.",unknown,Whether transcranial pulse stimulation can help people with Alzheimer's dementia has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies. Possible harmful effects have also been insufficiently researched.
37,Can low-level laser therapy reduce pain from knee or hip osteoarthritis?,"According to the research team behind the review, the study situation for low-level laser therapy in knee arthrosis is not sufficient to confirm or exclude efficacy. This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.",unknown,"In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
38,Can low-level laser therapy reduce wrist osteoarthritis pain?,"There is a well-made study on wrist arthritis: it showed no difference in efficacy between low-level laser therapy and placebo treatment. This was not the case, the laser treatment could not relieve the pain better than placebo treatment.",no,"In the pain treatment of wrist osteoarthritis, no efficacy can be assumed - this is indicated by the results of a small but well-done study. Research results on knee osteoarthritis are contradictory and therefore of little significance. We did not find any reliable studies on hip osteoarthritis."
39,Does blood type affect the likelihood that Covid 19 disease will take a severe course or lead to death?,"Here, the results found seem to contradict the influence of the blood group on the probability of death: the researchers found no connection between certain blood groups and the severity of the disease. Overall, the available data are not meaningful enough to establish or exclude a relationship between the blood group and the course of covid-19 disease. It is certain that no one is protected from a serious Covid-19 history because of their type of blood. No evidence of severe progression in certain blood groups The researchers found no evidence that in the case of a Covid-19 disease, people with a particular blood group need to be treated more frequently in hospital or intensive care units.",unknown,There is no reliable evidence that people with a certain blood group are more severely affected by covid-19 than those with another. Study results on this are poorly substantiated and partly contradictory.
40,"Do mouth rinses with hydroxyapatite, for example the products ""Linola sept mouth rinse"" and ""Karex Abwehr"", protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection?","In our search in three different scientific databases, we did not find any studies that investigated the supposed anti-coronavirus effect of the mouthwashes ""Linola sept"" and ""Karex Defense"". However, it is questionable whether patients have become healthy faster and this has not been studied. For the claim that mouthwashes with hydroxyapatite could avoid corona infections, there is no scientific evidence. Our conclusion: Scientific evidence of an effect of mouthwashes against Corona infections is missing. We could not find any studies that investigated whether Covid-19 patients would recover faster if they gurgled with hydroxyapatite solutions.",unknown,"There are no studies on the anti-corona effect of hydroxyapatite-containing mouth rinses such as ""Linola sept"" or ""Karex Abwehr"". We found no studies on the products themselves or on the alleged active ingredient hydroxyapatite. The claimed mechanism of action is not plausible."
41,Does CBD (cannabidiol) relieve symptoms of mild to moderate covid-19 disease?,"We can't say with absolute certainty that CBD is ineffective at Covid-19, but we think it is reasonably probable. In addition, there is evidence from other studies that CBD may even increase the susceptibility to infection [4]. Although she appears in some media reports, the report is simply wrong that the researchers had demonstrated an anti-corona effect of CBD in their study: According to the research team, CBD had no effect on the corona virus in the experiments. No benefit from CBD After 28 days, the study team took stock: Overall, the participants of the CBD group felt no better than those of the placebo group.",no,"CBD is unlikely to have any effect on the symptoms of covid-19 disease. This is the conclusion of the only study that has investigated this. However, its validity is somewhat limited due to the small number of participants. Not explored is a possible preventive effect. It is unclear whether CBD or other cannabis constituents - ingested or smoked - protect against corona infection or covid-19 disease."
42,Does CBD or cannabis use protect against covid-19 disease???,"No studies on CBD as covid protection We cannot answer whether the regular intake of CBD can prevent a Covid-19 disease, which has not yet been investigated. Although she appears in some media reports, the report is simply wrong that the researchers had demonstrated an anti-corona effect of CBD in their study: According to the research team, CBD had no effect on the corona virus in the experiments. Also, it appears that the regular intake of cannabinoids such as CBD can prevent covid-19 disease has not been studied.",unknown,"CBD is unlikely to have any effect on the symptoms of covid-19 disease. This is the conclusion of the only study that has investigated this. However, its validity is somewhat limited due to the small number of participants. Not explored is a possible preventive effect. It is unclear whether CBD or other cannabis constituents - ingested or smoked - protect against corona infection or covid-19 disease."
43,Do sedatives and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines and related substances increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia?,"However, it cannot be clearly dispelled by the fact that benzodiazepines and similar substances could promote the development of dementia.",unknown,"A link between the long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills and the development of dementia cannot be ruled out. However, whether the drugs are the cause of dementia is unclear. Likewise, it is possible that studies show a connection only because people in the undiagnosed early stages of dementia suffer more frequently from sleep disorders or restlessness and therefore take medication against them more often."
44,"Does taking polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 and omega-6, reduce ADHD symptoms in children?","Overall, the preparations do not seem to make children with ADHD quieter and more concentrated. Whether omega fatty acid preparations or placebo, all children showed similarly strong ADHD symptoms. On closer examination, it appears that the best-performed, blinded studies show no or even a negative effect of the omega fatty acid preparations on the behaviour of the participating children.",no,"Studies to date suggest that supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (for example, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) tend not to have a noticeable effect on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the quality of the studies is not sufficient to provide definitive answers."
45,Do infusions of vitamin C relieve symptoms of chronic fatigue or long covid?,"It is also unclear whether people with Long Covid benefit from vitamin C infusions. One of the two authors is also an employee of a pharmaceutical company that also offers products with vitamin C.  Since the developmental mechanisms of both chronic fatigue syndrome and long covid are unclear, studies with cancer patients or healthy participants cannot provide answers to the question whether vitamin C can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid.",unknown,Whether vitamin C infusions help with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is questionable. This has not yet been scientifically investigated. We also could not find a single study on vitamin C and fatigue occurring in the context of Long Covid.
46,Does taking probiotics shorten the duration of acute infectious diarrhea?,"Thus, at least in children, taking live probiotics is unlikely to affect whether they are still ill after 48 hours. Thus, a probiotic apparently has no clear influence on the resolution of the disease.",no,"According to current studies, the duration of disease cannot be reduced by taking probiotics. This assessment is reasonably well supported."
47,Does high-dose vitamin D slow down the course of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"However, such observations alone are not sufficient to actually demonstrate the benefit of highly dosed vitamin D in MS.   Studies on vitamin D in MS We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies on the high-dose treatment of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis. At present, we cannot say for sure whether highly dosed vitamin D actually brings benefits to MS. However, the data so far suggest that an effect, if any, would be rather small.",unknown,"We can neither clearly exclude nor confirm that there is an effect. In a total of 15 studies, no benefit could be demonstrated for high-dose vitamin D in adults with multiple sclerosis. Because the studies had many weaknesses, we cannot draw any conclusions about positive or negative effects."
48,Does taking taiga root extract strengthen the immune system? Can it make vaccinations more effective or tolerable?,"Taiga Root and Immune Defense: Extensive Studies Missing In our extensive research, we have not found any studies that can demonstrate an immune-strengthening effect of the Taiga Root. However, the studies were too small and inadequate for reliable results. Whether the taiga root is beneficial to the immune defense can not be proven at the present time – but also cannot be ruled out. The two available studies also do not provide any information on whether taiga root extract could even make vaccinations more effective.",unknown,The alleged immune-strengthening effect of taiga root (also called Siberian ginseng) has apparently never been investigated in appropriate studies. The positive effect claimed by dietary supplement manufacturers after vaccinations is also not proven.
49,"Can ozone therapy, in which autologous blood is treated with ozone and recycled, favorably influence the course of COVID-19 disease?","There are no differences between standard treatment and additional ozone therapy – neither in the progression of Covid-19 disease nor in the risk of death. An advantage for ozone therapy did not arise, for none of the comparisons there was a clear difference: neither for the risk of death to Covid-19 nor for the course of the disease [5]. Thus, the sole effect of autologous ozone therapy has not been established here either.",unknown,The few studies on this subject have gross deficiencies and are therefore not conclusive. Their results do not provide any evidence of efficacy of ozone therapy.
