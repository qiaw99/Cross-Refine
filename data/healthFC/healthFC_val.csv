0,Does geranium extract help against colds and sinusitis???,"The current study situation does not allow us to assess whether extracts from the Kapland pelargonia can alleviate the symptoms of a cold or shorten the duration of the disease. It is also unclear whether the Kapland pelargonia can help with a sinusitis [1]. Unfortunately, they are not the proof that extracts of the Kapland pelargony work the same way in the human body. It remains open whether the extract of the Kapland pelargonia can help with inflammation of the sinusoidal sinusitis or a cold. Thus, neither effectiveness nor ineffectiveness can be demonstrated.",unknown,There is evidence of a possible effect in bronchitis. The effectiveness for colds or sinusitis has hardly been researched in reliable studies. It is therefore still an open question whether substances from Cape pelargonium can favorably influence colds and sinusitis.
1,Does taking DHEA have an anti-aging effect by increasing the physical and mental well-being of older people?,"Many knowledge gaps Our conclusion: for none of these promises there is scientific evidence. They do not suggest an advantage by taking DHEA. In most studies, it made no difference whether participants took DHEA or a dummy medication. No study could have a positive effect on the quality of life compared to a sham drug [3,4]. In the event that DHEA should actually have a positive effect: it is not very likely that the hormone will bring a big difference, which will have a significant impact on the daily life of older people.",no,Previous studies show that well-being of body and soul is unlikely to change when older people take DHEA. The same applies to memory and sexual life. Whether DHEA prolongs life or improves health in old age has not yet been scientifically studied.
2,Can DHEA prolong life or improve health in old age?,"However, these are not meaningful because they have not investigated aspects that are important in the everyday life of old people – for example, whether DHEA lowers the risk of falls and fractures. However, the results are contradictory and cannot clarify whether the hormone can improve physical performance in old age. In the summary of studies with men, no difference between DHEA and a sham drug emerged [4]. We do not know whether DHEA has no effect – or whether an effect has simply not been detected yet. In the event that DHEA should actually have a positive effect: it is not very likely that the hormone will bring a big difference, which will have a significant impact on the daily life of older people.",unknown,Previous studies show that well-being of body and soul is unlikely to change when older people take DHEA. The same applies to memory and sexual life. Whether DHEA prolongs life or improves health in old age has not yet been scientifically studied.
3,Can the proper use of fluoride toothpaste cause serious long-term health problems?,"More investigations desired For proper use, however, no other undesirable effects are scientifically proven – apart from the mentioned (mild) dental fluorosis and possible tooth discoloration due to tin fluoride [1] [6] [8.9]. Neither on these nor on other negative health consequences could the authors of the systematic review find meaningful studies.",unknown,"The reduction of caries risk by fluoride-containing toothpaste is fairly well proven, especially for children and adolescents. Serious side effects have not been observed in studies to date when used properly. In children up to the age of about eight, regular swallowing of fluoride toothpaste can lead to mild dental fluorosis. However, this is not harmful to health. Long-term health problems are not known to date."
4,Does fluoride toothpaste prevent tooth decay?,"Previous studies have shown that cleaning with fluoride-containing toothpaste reduces the risk of caries. Fluoride counteracts caries by promoting the remineralization (""hardening"") of tooth enamel and counteracting demineralization. The studies in detail Three different scientific teams have come to the following conclusion: Fluoride-containing toothpaste probably protects children and adolescents from caries. Basis of our assessment The results of the studies with school children and adolescents are quite clear: It is quite plausible that fluoride toothpaste protects against caries.",yes,"The reduction of caries risk by fluoride-containing toothpaste is fairly well proven, especially for children and adolescents. Serious side effects have not been observed in studies to date when used properly. In children up to the age of about eight, regular swallowing of fluoride toothpaste can lead to mild dental fluorosis. However, this is not harmful to health. Long-term health problems are not known to date."
5,Do products with the tropical fruit mangosteen promote health?,"The fact that the mangostan can help with weight loss, however, cannot be derived from any of the three investigations. In summary, we can say whether mangostans in the form of extracts or juices help with weight loss or possibly alleviate the exhaustion of sports, we cannot answer. Mangostane as a drink The study of a mixed drink of mangostane and other fruits as a weight loss aid [4] is also very unreliable. In addition, it remains completely unclear whether the mangostane, another component or a mixture would be responsible for a suspected effect. The fact that this comparison drink was simply diluted with water of mangostan juice and the participants knew about it greatly limits the significance of the results.",unknown,"One study has investigated whether a drink containing mangosteen juice alleviates fatigue during exercise. Three other studies have investigated dietary supplements with extracts from the mangosteen for weight loss. However, none of these studies can demonstrate a positive effect."
6,"Are topical agents containing acids and oils, such as Excilor and Nailner, effective for nail fungus?","Only a handful of studies We are currently unable to answer whether remedies containing only oils and acids actually free affected toes and fingernails from the fungus. Although one or the other study author reports consistently positive effects, these investigations have gross shortcomings. These, however, have no scientific significance and can therefore not be used by us in the assessment of effectiveness/ineffectiveness of the nail fungus agent. Mushrooms love moist milieu Even if we can't say at this time whether oil or acid based means help with nail fungus, there are some ways of prevention and treatment.",unknown,"To date, there have been only a few studies dealing with the ingredients of such agents. These are of too poor quality to be able to make a statement on efficacy or inefficacy."
7,Can weight loss programs reduce obesity in children and adolescents?,"Promising combination Previous studies show that combined weight loss programs could actually have the ability to combat obesity in children and adolescents – even if the effect does not seem to be great. In the studies, overweight children of kindergarten age with such combination programs have lost 2.8 kilograms. Even schoolchildren between six and eleven could help such combined measures to reduce their weight a little. The combined results of previous studies do not only indicate that weight-reducing programs reduce BMI and overweight in children. Low quality of studies Overall, the results for all age groups point in the same direction: the combination programs can at least reduce weight and BMI a little.",yes,"Studies to date suggest that weight-loss programs involving diet, exercise or behavioral therapy - or a combination of these - can somewhat reduce obesity in children and adolescents. At least in adolescents, they are also likely to improve quality of life. Whether the programs also have a long-term effect, however, has hardly been studied."
8,Does valerian help with sleep disorders?,"Despite its popularity, science has so far not been able to gather good evidence of valerian's effectiveness as a sleeper. It is not proven that valerian can help to fall asleep more quickly [1,2]. Further Research Areas So the research to date on valerian has not yielded any clear results. They could not clearly show or exclude that valerian is effective in sleep disorders. So there was no clear difference between valerian and placebo in the time to fall asleep, in the overall sleeping time or in the efficient use of the sleeping time.",unknown,"Valerian is popular. However, studies have so far failed to provide good evidence of its effectiveness against sleep disorders."
9,Is milk thistle extract an effective treatment for liver disease?,"Also poorly performed are a number of studies that have investigated whether Mary's thistle improves certain liver values in the blood of hepatitis virus infected and other liver sufferers [4-6]. Therefore, only future studies can show whether the thistle can help here. However, it is insufficiently investigated whether the active substances from the thistle can actually help [7]. Although the efficacy of alcohol-related liver disease is unclear, the extract of Mary's thistle is popular for treatment [1]. Although the authors found a new study that investigated the effect of Mariendistel extract on the risk of cirrhosis in the liver, this study was of poor quality and not meaningful.",unknown,Previous studies on this have been poorly conducted and are therefore not conclusive enough. Whether milk thistle can improve liver disease due to alcohol abuse or hepatitis B or C is unclear.
10,Do dietary supplements with amino acids and proteins help against muscle atrophy in old age (sarcopenia)?,"Since sarcopenia has only recently been officially established as a defined disease, we had to assume that research on the subject is still in its early stages. No basis for recommendations This is what our research has shown [1-3]: Regarding protein supplements, the study situation is so contradictory that we cannot detect any tendencies or even make clear statements. We do not know whether supplements containing amino acids and proteins can prevent or significantly delay the outbreak of sarcopenia. Our conclusion: All in all, we cannot make a clear assessment of the effectiveness and safety of food supplements with amino acids or proteins for sarcopenia patients. The authors had to leave open whether sarcopenia patients could benefit significantly from food supplements due to a lack of data.",unknown,"There is scattered evidence that taking amino acids can help people with sarcopenia. However, more well-done studies are needed. This is the only way to reliably assess whether the alleged effect actually exists, how large it is, and what the ideal dose, optimal duration of intake, and possible side effects are."
11,Can music therapy help people affected by stroke learn to walk normally again?,"Music Therapy as Go Training Previously published studies show that music therapy is likely to improve the ability to go [1]. According to the study results, rhythmic music seems to be better at training step movements than a rhythm without music, such as the simple tick-tack of a metronome. After rhythmic music therapy, their stride length was slightly larger, and they averaged 11 meters more per minute. However, all individual results point to benefits in terms of step speed and length studies. Therefore, the authors consider music therapy with rhythmic-acoustic stimulation to be likely effective in walking disorders.",yes,"Music therapy that works with rhythm can probably help people with a walking disorder to walk faster again and take larger steps. It is still unclear whether music therapy after a stroke can also help with problems with speech, limited movement of the arms, hands and fingers, difficulties with memory or attention, or depression."
12,Can music therapy help stroke victims with other problems???,"Research gaps It is not well researched whether music therapy can help if the mobility of the arms or hands is limited. Whether sufferers benefit from singing or other forms of music therapy when they have problems with speaking after the stroke is also unclear at present. The study situation is also insufficient for other impairments. So it is not possible to say at the moment whether music therapy is helpful for example in problems with memory and attention. Whether music therapy can reduce depression in stroke patients has been studied in some studies, but these differ too much in the way they perform, in order to be able to safely assess the effectiveness.",unknown,"Music therapy that works with rhythm can probably help people with a walking disorder to walk faster again and take larger steps. It is still unclear whether music therapy after a stroke can also help with problems with speech, limited movement of the arms, hands and fingers, difficulties with memory or attention, or depression."
13,Does plant or animal protein have an influence on lifespan?,"Plant proteins and animal proteins from certain sources (fish, poultry, eggs) seem to have a positive effect. Herbal protein may reduce the likelihood of dying earlier due to cardiovascular disease, cancer or other reasons [1-3]. Proteins from fish and eggs could also have a certain protective effect [2]. Those who consumed more eggs, fish and legumes were less likely to die.",yes,"It is possible that vegetable protein and animal protein from eggs, poultry and fish have a more favorable effect on lifespan than proteins from red meat. However, it is unclear how strong this possible effect is or in which groups of people it unfolds."
14,Does chicken soup help with colds?,"However, such experiments – even though they may sound so promising – do not provide any evidence that the soup also works the same in the human body. Chicken soup in case of cold: theories without evidence Extensive studies on the effect of chicken soup do not exist, but all the more attempts to explain them. As long as there are no studies with human subjects, we simply cannot assess whether and which chicken soup ingredients could help cold-stricken people.",unknown,"So far, this has only been investigated in laboratory experiments. Studies on efficacy in humans are missing so far. Therefore, we can not judge whether chicken soup is helpful for colds."
15,"Do herbal remedies containing an extract of Chinese tragacanth root, such as Lectranal or Allvent, help against allergies?","Tragant against allergies: hardly investigated In the course of our extensive literature research, we were able to track down only one study on 48 adult persons [1], which the manufacturer also quotes in the package leaflet [5]. Why the manufacturer speaks in the package leaflet of a good effectiveness of the product also for allergies against animal hair or mold spores, therefore remains unclear. In a second search round we also searched for these allergy forms, but found no studies. So it would only be necessary for further, well done, extensive studies to determine the effectiveness of the tragant root. The evaluation produced rather disappointing results: In total, there were no significant differences between tragant and sham medication after three or six weeks.",unknown,"So far, there is only one study with a few participants, and the results are not particularly convincing."
16,Does alkaline water keep you healthy or can it prevent disease?,"Not plausible, hardly investigated Scientifically plausible, the concept of such acidification of the body is not. There are hardly any studies on the subject – and the ones that exist are too badly done to provide meaningful answers. On the basis of the current study situation, we cannot assess whether or what positive or negative effects the regular consumption of basic water could have on healthy adults. However, it does not seem particularly plausible so far that significant preventive or healing effects can be achieved. For example, it is not clear whether the different composite (and therefore not necessarily comparable) base water actually achieves the supposed effect due to its high pH value or the added minerals [1] [5].",unknown,It is unclear whether alkaline water can promote health or prevent disease in healthy adults. Well-done studies on the subject are lacking. Large effects from alkaline drinking water are not likely.
17,Do remedies with hops or valerian help with anxiety disorders?,"Whether they really promote a restful sleep, however, is not sufficiently clarified – we have already reported on it (see the contributions to hops and valerian). Studies on valerian and hops little meaningful In our comprehensive literature research, we could only find two clinical studies on valerian [1,2] and one on hops [3]. The results, however, leave open whether the fear from the plant remedies could be reduced only slightly or also to a noticeable extent. Due to the small number of participants and inaccuracies in the execution of the studies, the results are also not trustworthy. Hops For the evaluation of hops we could only identify a single study [3].",unknown,The results of previous studies are not conclusive. The reason is that too few participants were examined in them and the studies were also poorly conducted.
18,Do extracts of African devil's claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis?,"Lack of scientific evidence Whether or not those affected have to deal with their pain through Devil's claw preparations and thus swallow less painkillers remains questionable. For example, so far published studies investigated too few people to provide meaningful results. The duration of the study was too short with a few weeks to months to assess the efficacy of chronic disease such as osteoarthritis [1] [7]. However, the present studies do not provide any evidence of actual efficacy in osteoarthritis [1] [4]. The result: The authors can neither recommend nor advise devil claws nor most other herbal remedies for osteoarthritis.",unknown,"Currently, there are no well-conducted studies to assess the efficacy of devil's claw extracts in worn joints."
19,Can probiotics prevent diarrhea after treatment with antibiotics?,"They can support the intestinal flora and should prevent diarrhea. Probiotics: less diarrhea after antibiotics A summary of the results of previous studies shows: Probiotics can probably prevent antibiotic-related diarrhea [1] [3]. Probiotics also seem to be able to reduce the risk of diarrhea through this germ [3,4]. Infectious diarrhea may also be helped by probiotics against diarrhea caused by infectious disease.",yes,Probiotics can likely reduce the risk of diarrhea after antibiotics.
20,Is exercise an effective measure to combat depression?,"Activities against depression The fact that physical training could have a positive effect on depression sounds valid: After all, achieving sporting goals brings success experiences and leads to a strengthening of self-esteem. Moderate relief from sports In fact, the summarized results of previous studies [1-4] show that sports can probably alleviate depression. On average, regular endurance or strength sports can probably improve the complaints of depressive people by a point on a scale of one to ten [1-3]. Nevertheless, the three overviews come to a similar conclusion: Sports can probably alleviate depression symptoms by around one point on a ten-stage scale in the short term. However, the fact that sports seem to alleviate depression is also evident when only the results of high-quality studies are summarized.",yes,"Current scientific evidence suggests that exercise can alleviate the symptoms of depression. However, the positive effect is only moderately pronounced. Sport does not work any better than current treatments (antidepressants, psychotherapy)."
21,Can a tantrum trigger a heart attack?,"Anger could pose a threat to one's own health in two different ways: on the one hand, as a trigger, for example, when a rage leads directly to a heart attack. And, on the other hand, as a long-term risk factor, it would be conceivable that people with frequent feelings of anger have a higher risk of cardiovascular damage. The result is clear at first glance: within two hours of a tantrum, the risk of a heart attack seems to be increased. Many of them seem to show that people with frequent feelings of anger also suffer from a heart attack more often. Even the study with the smallest effect – which is at the same time the one with the most participants – shows an at least two to three times higher risk, including fluctuation range.",yes,The likelihood of a heart attack may be increased in the hours following an episode of anger. Whether frequent anger over many years leads to a higher risk of heart attack overall has not been proven.
22,Can anger over a long period of time increase the risk of heart attack???,"It is therefore unclear whether feelings of anger can cause a heart attack over the years. Only future, better-executed studies with high numbers of participants can provide an answer. However, whether the cause of the increased risk of myocardial infarction actually lies in the tantrums cannot be demonstrated with certainty. However, the combined data of these studies have the same problem as those of the two similar observational studies published later [3,4]: their variability is too large to show a risk increase. At the same time, however, they cannot rule out that frequent anger over the years increases the risk of heart attacks.",unknown,The likelihood of a heart attack may be increased in the hours following an episode of anger. Whether frequent anger over many years leads to a higher risk of heart attack overall has not been proven.
23,Can capsules with omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil relieve depression?,"Omega-3 fatty acids: Effect questionable The summary of the results of all the work that omega-3 fatty acids have studied in people with depression, unfortunately, comes to an unsatisfactory result: The studies carried out so far are of such poor quality that a clear statement is not possible [1]. The authors of the review conclude that the data so far are not sufficient to assess the effect or possible side effects of fish oil in the treatment of depressive symptoms. So the effect of regular fish consumption on the sympotoma of depression remains entirely open. Omega-3 fatty acids cannot convince The independent research network Cochrane summarized all studies that investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in adults with depression [1]. Based on the current study situation, it remains questionable whether fish oil works better in case of depression than a sham medication.",unknown,"The studies conducted to date are hardly trustworthy. Their combined results do not suggest that omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil could appreciably alleviate depression. In studies comparing fish oil with drugs for depression, the omega-3 fatty acids appeared to work worse than the drugs."
24,Does regular consumption of coffee increase the risk of heart disease such as heart attack or stroke?,"Their results show: even those who drink coffee regularly should not have an increased risk of being hit by heart attack, stroke and co [1]. It is therefore conceivable that coffee does not increase the probability of dying early due to heart problems or other reasons. Not only does coffee probably not harm the heart: the studies published so far even provide evidence that it could be healthy for the heart in moderate amounts (three to four cups a day) and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Their results suggest that moderate amounts of coffee (three to four cups) also reduce the risk of premature death from cardiovascular disease or other causes [2.3]. Neither the two systematic survey work [5.6] nor the cohort study found a statistical link between coffee consumption and the occurrence of atrial fibrillation when other factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption or advanced age were taken into account in the evaluation.",no,"Studies of people who are healthy and drink coffee regularly do not appear to show an increased risk of heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular disease. On the contrary, they even suggest that coffee may reduce the likelihood of these."
25,Do cesarean babies have a higher risk of becoming overweight later in life?,"The findings from three works indicate that a cesarean section could increase the risk of an unhealthy weight later in life. Three research groups report that a cesarean section could make overweight and obesity somewhat more likely in later life [3, 4] [6].",yes,"There is evidence that birth by cesarean section may slightly increase the risk of obesity later in life. For asthma, allergies and type 1 diabetes, an increase in risk due to a cesarean section is unclear. Overall, it is not yet clear whether there is a direct causal relationship between the type of delivery and the development of diseases in childhood, adolescence and adulthood."
26,Do cesarean babies have a higher risk of asthma and allergies later in life? Do they have an increased risk of type 1 diabetes??,"However, none of these analyses could clearly prove cause and effect. It is therefore not assured that the type of birth is the cause of the subsequent health risk [3, 4] [6]. There is also uncertainty as to whether babies brought to the world by caesarean section will later suffer from allergic diseases, asthma or type 1 diabetes. Further findings: methodologically inadequate It also remains uncertain whether the autoimmune disease type 1 occurs more frequently after a caesarean section.",unknown,"There is evidence that birth by cesarean section may slightly increase the risk of obesity later in life. For asthma, allergies and type 1 diabetes, an increase in risk due to a cesarean section is unclear. Overall, it is not yet clear whether there is a direct causal relationship between the type of delivery and the development of diseases in childhood, adolescence and adulthood."
27,Does the pregnancy hormone hCG help with weight loss?,"Losing weight with hCG is a myth The fact that the pregnancy hormone can probably not help with weight loss has been established since the early 1990s at the latest. Overall, the summarized studies show that hCG probably does not lead to any greater weight loss than injections with an ineffective dummy medication or no hormone at all. In addition, in none of the studies, hormone treatment was able to induce the loss of fat in certain parts of the body. Warning of hCG diet Although injections with the hormone hCG do not help to get rid of obesity, in another area they still have a medically proven benefit, for example in the treatment of infertility in women. The FDA also recommends that hCG injections be dispensed with for weight loss.",no,Studies conducted to date on this issue contradict this assertion
28,Does cupping relieve chronic neck and back pain?,"Studies on cupping not meaningful Especially people with back and neck pain hope to relieve their pain with a cupping therapy. However, the scientific quality of these studies is very low and the results are hardly meaningful. They can therefore not answer whether or not it can help with neck and back pain. The studies in detail Although there are many studies with careful indications of the effectiveness of cramps in chronic neck and back pain, this can still not be scientifically proven to this day. Recent Studies A randomized-controlled study of 39 patients suffering from back pain did not produce a clear result.",unknown,Studies to date are of too low quality to provide a meaningful answer.
29,Can eating broccoli or broccoli sprouts improve gastritis symptoms?,"Efficacy of broccoli hardly investigated We could not find any studies that investigated the effect of normal broccoli vegetables on gastritis patients. However, tests in the laboratory do not indicate whether broccoli or any part of the vegetable has the same effect in people with gastritis. A clear proof that the consumption of broccoli or broccoli sprouts can successfully contain a gastritis or its possible consequence, a stomach ulcer, is missing. The studies in detail of normal broccoli were not tested in any study of gastritis patients. It has not been studied whether a diet rich in broccoli has a beneficial effect on gastritis.",unknown,"So far, there is a lack of well-done human studies that would show that eating broccoli or broccoli sprouts can help with gastritis."
30,Do Schuessler salts work? (alternative spellings: Schuessler salts or Schuessler salts),"This means that no one has ever investigated whether the ""biochemical"" pills, according to their inventor, are proven to work. Why the intake of such small amounts of a mineral salt should be therapeutically effective, while many times it is absorbed by food, is scientifically unexplainable [1].",unknown,"The concept of Schüßler salts is not scientifically plausible. Moreover, the effectiveness of the alternative medical method has never been investigated in studies."
31,Does pelvic floor training help women with stress-related urinary incontinence?,"In this form of bladder weakness, training the pelvic floor is likely to help the most [1]. Studies have shown that pregnant women who train their pelvic floor before and after birth can prevent involuntary urinary loss. In case of mixed incontinence between stress and urge incontinence, pelvic floor training is also useful [1]. Therefore, pregnant women are advised to do pelvic floor training as a preventive measure against incontinence. According to this work, the risk of becoming incontinent shortly after the birth of the first child can be significantly reduced by preventive pelvic floor gymnastics.",yes,"Several systematic reviews confirm the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training in different groups of patients. Slight doubts exist only because the individual studies use very different methods, which makes an overall evaluation difficult."
32,Can methadone enhance the effects of chemotherapy or other cancer treatments and help cure cancer?,"According to reports, treatment with methadone is said to have successfully cured many people from cancer. So far it has not been scientifically investigated whether methadone can actually increase the chances of survival of cancer patients. The theory behind it In theory, the possibly anti-cancer effect of methadone sounds quite plausible. For example, a German researcher and her working group found that methadone makes cancer cells more sensitive to the growth-inhibiting effect of chemotherapy substances in test tubes. In addition, methadone appears to increase the likelihood of cancer cells dying at least in laboratory experiments [1].",unknown,"So far, this has not been verified in scientific studies."
33,Can treatment with tea tree oil relieve pimples (acne)?,"Possible help against pimples Although tea tree oil helps against pimples, it has not been proven to be stable and sticky – yet there are indications of such an effect. After six weeks, the number of pimples and mites appeared to have decreased more strongly in the users of the tea tree oil gel than in those who had applied the gel without active substance [1]. After six weeks, the participants who used the gel with tea tree oil had less than seven to eight skin impurities on average, such as pimples, blackheads or pustules, than those who had applied the non-active gel.",yes,"While a small study provides tentative evidence that tea tree oil may help against pimples, only further, well-done studies can provide scientific certainty."
34,Does sugar consumption impair memory or other mental performance?,"There was no link between sugar and mental performance. Whether regular consumption of large quantities of sugar actually makes stupid in the long term, this study cannot answer for the general population. There are some studies on the short-term effect of sugar on our thinking apparatus, but hardly one is strictly carried out according to scientific criteria and therefore meaningful. However, caution is required here: only because sugar increases the risk of diabetes and diabetes sufferers more frequently from Alzheimer's disease, does this not mean that sugar causes mental degradation in old age [7]. However, these studies do not indicate that sugar has a damaging effect on the human brain, as the results of animal experiments cannot be transmitted to humans.",unknown,Whether a high-sugar diet impairs mental performance in the long term has not been adequately researched; there is a lack of conclusive studies over a long period of time.
35,Does extra folic acid in men help prevent birth defects in children?,"There are no studies that investigate the association of folic acid deficiency with birth defects in men of the human species. But even on this question, there are few and still insufficient studies, the results of which are by no means clear [3][4][5]: In men with fertility problems, the sperm count is increased and some characteristics of the sperm [3] improve. Whether the improvement is so great that it actually has an impact on fertility is not yet clear.",unknown,"There is no clinical study on this question in humans. Some laboratory studies show a possible influence of folic acid on sperm quality, but even there the study situation is by no means sufficient. An influence on birth defects has not been investigated."
36,Does taking ginger reduce nausea and vomiting during pregnancy?,"Ginger as a remedy against nausea: hardly investigated To the question whether the preventive intake of ginger helps prevent a travel disease, we could only find a single study with relatively few participants, which Ginger examined under everyday conditions [5]. We cannot rule out, but cannot prove, that ginger is helping against travel sickness on the basis of the current study situation. Contradictory results on ginger in pregnancy A little better is the study situation on ginger against pregnancy breakage [1–4]. Because the individual investigations were very different and have different methodological problems, it is therefore also possible to ask whether ginger can relieve nausea at the beginning of a pregnancy, unfortunately no reliable statement can be made. Thus, for ginger as a remedy against travel sickness as well as for pregnancy sickness, further and better studies are needed.",unknown,"There are some studies on ginger as a remedy for nausea in early pregnancy, but the results are contradictory. As a remedy for motion sickness, ginger has almost not been studied at all. In a small study against seasickness, ginger partially reduced symptoms, but whether the effect is large enough for people to actually notice it while traveling cannot be said for sure based on this study."
37,Does taking ginger prevent motion sickness??,"The study does not answer whether the effect is strong enough to actually make a difference for travellers. While there are some other tests that ginger has tested under laboratory conditions, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions on the effectiveness of nausea on a ship, aircraft or coach. We cannot rule out, but cannot prove, that ginger is helping against travel sickness on the basis of the current study situation. Because the individual investigations were very different and have different methodological problems, it is therefore also possible to ask whether ginger can relieve nausea at the beginning of a pregnancy, unfortunately no reliable statement can be made. Thus, for ginger as a remedy against travel sickness as well as for pregnancy sickness, further and better studies are needed.",unknown,"There are some studies on ginger as a remedy for nausea in early pregnancy, but the results are contradictory. As a remedy for motion sickness, ginger has almost not been studied at all. In a small study against seasickness, ginger partially reduced symptoms, but whether the effect is large enough for people to actually notice it while traveling cannot be said for sure based on this study."
38,Are electric cigarettes less harmful than tobacco smoking?,"Even more side effects There are still too few clinical studies to know to what extent e-cigarettes pose a health risk. The studies in detail In the course of our extensive literature search, we could not find good studies that allow an assessment of how the years of use of e-cigarettes could affect health. In addition, few well-made individual studies are available. Too few studies showing effects The authors of a recent review of the Cochrane Association also looked for studies on whether e-cigarettes could help smokers stop smoking [1]. The authors of the work also complain that there are hardly any well-made studies that show how e-cigarettes cut off compared to conventional weaning agents such as nicotine patches or chewing gum.",unknown,"Clinical studies on e-cigarettes are thin on the ground. The ingredients are extremely varied, and their long-term effects are unknown. Only long-term studies will provide certainty."
39,Does parents licking the pacifier protect children from allergic diseases?,"However, the interaction of the micro-living beings with our body is far from sufficiently researched to answer the effects of parental oral bacteria in children or what exactly is a healthy colonization of the body by bacteria. What else does the pacifier do In connection with pacifiers, there are some other health issues that are not finally resolved. However, the number of children is too small to draw such a conclusion. Thus, the results of the study are not meaningful.",unknown,"There is only one study on this issue. However, the results are not conclusive."
40,Does calcium help with allergy?,"In addition, none of the investigations examines the effect of calcium in normal everyday life, but only under artificial laboratory conditions and in the case of hay fever outside the allergy season. Since no patients with real allergy are tested here, we also consider these investigations to be of little help to our questions [10]. Therefore, it cannot be derived from this study whether calcium would also help against allergic asthma in the ""Ernstfall"" [11]. And calcium is disappointed: in neither of these studies can a difference be established between calcium and a sham drug [5,6]. Whether calcium actually helps against allergies or an allergy can be avoided with it, is therefore not investigated in meaningful studies or even proven.",unknown,"Whether the preventive intake of calcium helps against different types of allergy has not been investigated in meaningful studies. The available studies either examine participants without allergy, measure only one-time reactions and artificial situations, or do not test effects that actually matter to patients."
41,Can taking vitamin D relieve chronic pain?,"Overall, the studies so far do not provide a clear indication that vitamin D can improve chronic pain. Since several work on vitamin D and pain disorders are in progress, there could be more clarity here in the future [1]. Therefore, the vitamin deficiency must not necessarily be the cause of the pain, nor must the pain automatically improve when vitamin D is swallowed. Studies very different Because the disease patterns and the type of vitamin D treatments differ too much from one another, the data from the individual studies could not be combined for an overall evaluation. However, because even in the analysed small studies hardly any convincing effects of vitamin D on chronic pain were found, the authors of the review conclude that vitamin D should not contribute to the improvement of these diseases.",unknown,Studies to date are contradictory. They cannot provide a clear indication that vitamin D can alleviate chronic pain; further studies are needed.
42,Does aloe vera relieve discomfort caused by psoriasis?,"Even if Aloe vera is an ingredient of numerous cosmetic products, this is not yet a proof of a medical effect. The results were rather disappointing: In total, it cannot be said whether Aloe vera can help here. For this skin disease, the effect of Aloe vera has not yet been investigated in clinical studies. Unfortunately, however, their results strongly contradict each other, so it is not possible to say whether Aloe Vera can actually do something against psoriasis [2,3]. A new systematic review [3] has changed our assessment of the effectiveness of psoriasis from ""possibly yes"" to ""not sufficiently researched"".",unknown,There is no evidence of efficacy for any of these skin problems. At least partially conclusive studies exist only for psoriasis - but there the results are contradictory.

44,Does electromagnetic radiation from cell phone towers cause health problems such as headaches or sleep disorders?,"Electrosensitivity: Symptoms do not arise from cell phone masts In our extensive search in medical databases we found two overviews, which summarize the results of previously published studies on electrosensitivity sufficiently objectively. The results of the experiments suggest that the reason for headaches and sleep problems were not cell phone poles. The fact that cell phone masts are not responsible for reported concentration problems is even likely, according to the study results. Although less than 200 people took part in the studies, this reduces the expressiveness somewhat – but all three come to the same conclusion: cell phone masts are unlikely to affect the mental performance of electrosensitive people. Therefore, the fact that cell phone masts can cause headaches does not seem to be the case overall.",no,"The few studies on electrosensitivity so far tend to indicate that it is not the cell phone masts themselves that affect the health of electrosensitive people. Their complaints such as headaches, sleep disturbances or concentration problems are more likely to be triggered by concerns about cell phone tower radiation. Long-term studies in the field are still lacking."
45,Can antibiotic-resistant germs from animal husbandry be transferred to humans?,"However, studies indicate that transmission to humans is possible. For example, persons such as farmers, veterinarians or slaughterhouse workers who have frequent contact with farm animals for professional reasons are likely to be more likely to be populated with resistant bacteria than persons from the general population [1] [8] [10–12]. Their summarized results show that people with close contact with animals such as farmers, veterinarians or slaughterhouse workers are actually more frequently populated than the average population with the so-called ""livestock-associated MRSA"". From this, the study authors conclude that a transfer of resistant germs from animals to humans is in principle possible. Although this type of study may give indications that antibiotic use in animal husbandry will transfer resistant pathogens to humans, it is not possible to provide clear evidence.",yes,"Whether the use of antibiotics in agricultural animal husbandry could directly harm human health is currently not sufficiently researched. However, studies indicate that transmission of resistant bacterial strains from pigs and co to people who have direct contact with animals in farm animal fattening is possible."
46,Does the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry harm human health?,"However, we cannot answer whether the resistant bacteria from animal husbandry pose an immediate threat to humans because of the currently poor study situation. Although this type of study may give indications that antibiotic use in animal husbandry will transfer resistant pathogens to humans, it is not possible to provide clear evidence. However, the predominantly poor quality of the studies analysed strongly limits the significance of these results.",unknown,"Whether the use of antibiotics in agricultural animal husbandry could directly harm human health is currently not sufficiently researched.

47,Does regular vitamin D intake lower the risk of cancer in adults?,"However, these findings do not suggest that the regular intake of vitamin D can prevent the risk of cancer even in the right life. Vitamin D cannot prevent cancer Such studies have also been actually carried out. The combined data of all these studies are sobering: for the frequency of cancer, it probably makes no difference whether you take vitamin D preparations or not. Despite the large number of participants, it could theoretically be that not enough people have been studied in the studies and therefore no effect has been found.",no,"Studies lasting up to seven years and involving a total of around 50,000 participants have been unable to find any effect."
48,Does regular consumption of ground flaxseed harm health?,"No clear statements possible Unfortunately, the question remains open: In the context of our literature search, we could not find well-made studies which would have investigated the effects of the consumption of crushed or whole linseed on health. The concentration of thiocyanate in the blood and urine increased significantly; however, there is no scientifically clear evidence to date that an increased thiocyanate level may harm health [2, 3, 5]. In this context, however, there are many questions that need to be clarified in well done investigations, for example: what is the difference in cyanide uptake between whole and broken flaxseed? On the other hand, there are gaps in knowledge about what happens in the body when linseed is regularly eaten over a longer period of time. Scientific evidence for this assumption is missing [3].",unknown,"Currently, there are no well-done studies that have investigated whether daily consumption of ground flaxseed over an extended period of time can be detrimental to health."
49,1. can MMR vaccination cause autism?,"Analyses have found that there is probably no association with various (combination) vaccinations. After an evaluation of numerous studies, the German Paul Ehrlich Institute could not confirm this suspicion. Autism: refuted, but still discussed In the debate about possible vaccination damage, however, there are still many rumors that have long been refuted with scientific investigations. In higher quality studies involving more than half a million children, there has been no correlation between MMR vaccination and autism [1-3]. According to the previous observational studies, we therefore consider it likely that the MMR vaccination cannot trigger autism.",no,"Autism: A study that found a link was later exposed as a hoax. Subsequent studies of more than half a million children have not confirmed the claim.,Intestinal intussusceptions: There is evidence that infants vaccinated against rotavirus have a slightly higher risk of intestinal intussusception than those not vaccinated. At the same time, vaccination makes it likely that babies will be significantly less likely to develop severe diarrhea within the next two years."
50,3. does vaccination against rotavirus increase the risk of intestinal intussusception in infants?,"In severe cases, this causes parts of the intestine to die. There is evidence that this problem may occur slightly more frequently after vaccination against rotaviren. However, the data in the other five studies are consistent with the hypothesis that in very rare cases the vaccine increases the risk of intestinal intrusion. The authors of the review evaluate these findings as a weak indication of a slightly increased risk, especially in the first week after the first dose of the vaccine. In vaccinated people, the risk was twice as high as in unvaccinated people.",yes,"Autism: A study that found a link was later exposed as a hoax. Subsequent studies of more than half a million children have not confirmed the claim.,Intestinal intussusceptions: There is evidence that infants vaccinated against rotavirus have a slightly higher risk of intestinal intussusception than those not vaccinated.

51,Is ozone suitable for the treatment of tooth decay?,"Unfortunately, the current study situation does not provide any really tangible evidence. In other words, we still do not know enough about the potential long-term benefits and risks of caries ozone treatment. Lack of good examination of ozone therapy for teeth A few years ago, the two independent organizations ""Cochrane Collaboration"" and ""The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)"" came to the conclusion that well done studies on ozone therapy of caries are still pending [1, 2]. Therefore, the authors could not assess whether ozone treatment can stop caries or even reverse the tooth-decomposition process. However, the studies found and included in the analysis were not sufficient to assess the meaningfulness of treating caries with ozone; the further question as to whether the treatment ""calculated"" compared to already established methods could therefore not be pursued further.",unknown,"Treating caries quickly and painlessly with ozone instead of syringes, drills and fillings - that sounds tempting. However, well-done studies on the efficacy and safety of ozone treatment are lacking. To be sure, there are some positive indications. But they are not enough to recommend ozone therapy for the general public."
52,Does the so-called blood group diet have any health benefits?,"In theory, therefore, the blood group diet is not plausible. However, the results of the study on MNS blood groups and cholesterol levels are not reliable due to quality deficiencies and do not answer the question about the benefit of AB0 blood group diet [3]. However, the results also showed that the effects of the diet on the measured health parameters did not depend on whether the food matched the respective blood type. Thus, a health benefit of the blood group diet has not been proven to this day, although corresponding nutrition patterns have been propagated for more than 20 years. The results of the study are therefore of little relevance and do not allow for clear conclusions.",unknown,"Already the theory of the blood group diet is scientifically implausible. More importantly, there are no conclusive studies that prove any health benefits of this diet."
53,"Can pumpkin seeds or preparations from them help women and men with irritable bladder, bladder weakness or incontinence?","Pumpkin seeds in irritable bladder and incontinence questionable As a herbal remedy for discomfort caused by an irritable bladder or incontinence, products from pumpkin seeds have been advertised for some time. So far, studies have not been able to prove that pumpkin seeds are an effective remedy. It is therefore questionable whether pumpkin seeds can actually help with irritable bladder and incontinence. Previous studies show that pumpkin seeds probably cannot improve bladder problems if they are caused by benign prostate enlargement, see: Pumpkin seeds useless for the prostate In another article, we looked at other herbal remedies for prostate problems.",unknown,Whether pumpkin seeds can help has not yet been sufficiently researched.
54,"Do products from bees like honey, propolis, royal jelly or bee venom help against cancer?","Hope so far only in the test tube Up to now only experimental animals and cancer cells in the test tube have been investigated whether products of bees could possibly work against cancer. However, it remains questionable whether these products also work against cancer in the human body. Therefore, it is not currently possible to say whether bees' products can contribute to cancer therapy. In addition, their persuasiveness diminishes, that usually only a few cancer sufferers have participated in it. It is therefore not clear from the previous work whether bees' products could actually help those affected [1-7].",unknown,"So far, only laboratory experiments in the Petri dish and animal studies have been carried out. Studies on cancer patients are still lacking. Therefore, it is currently not possible to assess whether such products are also suitable as a remedy for cancer in humans."
55,Do pumpkin seed preparations improve symptoms caused by a benign enlarged prostate?,"Pumpkin seeds do not improve prostate complaints In an extensive search for previously published studies, we have found only two studies that have investigated the effect of pumpkin seeds on a benign enlarged prostate. The results of both studies show that pumpkin seeds are unlikely to improve the complaints of affected men [1,2]. At the end of the one-year study, however, the participants of the pumpkin seed group did not classify their complaints as noticeably better than those of the dummy preparation group. After one year of treatment with pumpkin seed extract, prostate complaints were no better than in those who had swallowed placebo capsules.",no,"In two studies, symptoms did not improve even after one year of treatment."
56,"Can gels and ointments containing arnica, hawthorn, cypress, butcher's broom, Asian (or Indian) pennywort, and heparin, such as VaricoFix, relieve discomfort and secondary symptoms of varicose veins?","Lubricating completely unexplored package can be said straight away: It is completely unexplored whether ointments or gels can help with varicose veins at all, no matter what active substance they contain. The study situation is also poor with regard to the individual ingredients. However, common to traditional remedies is that their effectiveness is usually not proven by clinical studies, but is based on application and experience over a period of at least 30 years [8, 9]. Our team of Medical-Transparent.at, on the other hand, could not find any evidence that the legs become varicose veins-free by treatment with cyanoacrylate – a kind of superglue that should close the veins.",unknown,There are no good studies on the efficacy of the above-mentioned combination of active ingredients or on individual ingredients of VaricoFix. No scientifically proven statements can be made about possible side effects of the preparation either.
57,Does putting onion bags help with acute otitis media?,"We can neither confirm nor exclude that onion packets help, because there are simply no studies on this subject. So we do not know whether onion packets can shorten the duration of the disease or whether they can alleviate discomfort. The lack of a good analysis of the use of onion packets in acute middle ear inflammation is not surprising: Traditional home remedies are rarely the subject of well-planned and therefore expensive scientific studies. In the absence of studies, we cannot say whether onion packets are actually effective, i.e.",unknown,"There is a lack of good studies on the use of onion bags in children suffering from acute otitis media. Therefore, we cannot make any statements about a possible benefit of this home remedy. However, it can be said that the common ear infections usually heal without complications."
58,Can serious problems occur after stopping antidepressants?,"If patients want to do without their antidepressants, very unpleasant side effects can occur. Similar symptoms are also known for other drugs with effects on the central nervous system, such as strong sedatives (benzodiazepines) or drugs used to treat schizophrenia. Thus, withdrawal symptoms can mainly affect all patients, because typically it is recommended to take antidepressants at least six months after the end of the depressive episode. However, the problems can also occur with newer active substances such as escitalopram [1] or duloxetine [4]. Many questions open There are cautious indications that after stopping antidepressants other serious symptoms may also occur, such as a mania [3].",yes,It is now well documented that discontinuing certain antidepressants can lead to health problems. The symptoms are similar to those experienced when withdrawing from strong tranquilizers.
59,Does self urine help with health problems?,"Urine: No effect on cancer or allergies The use of eigenurin therapy, including self-harn treatment, is wide ranging from drinking or gurgling to rubbing into the skin and injections under the skin or entrails [9–11] [13]. However, apart from anecdotal reports, we could not find a single study that would show a therapeutic effect of urine. However, the effect could not be confirmed in subsequent studies [6-8]. No efficacy could be established for eigenurin therapy in the treatment of allergies [2]. Although it has not been established whether antibiotic-resistant germs in the urine would actually lead to more infectious diseases when the urine is re-administered.",unknown,There is not a single health complaint for which there is proof of efficacy of a urine application.
60,Do unsaturated fats (from plants and fish) reduce cardiovascular disease compared to saturated fats (from meat and dairy products)?,Those who throttle their consumption of saturated fats and instead resort to unsaturated ones are highly likely to reduce their own heart risk. The summary analysis of all these study results clearly shows that people who replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats or at least reduce their consumption of saturated fats also reduce their risk of cardiovascular diseases. The studies in detail The insight from the summarized results of the 15 clinical studies published so far on the topic is clear: Those who consume less saturated fats for at least two years will probably reduce their own risk for cardiovascular diseases [2]. The greatest risk minimisation was found in those studies in which participants should replace saturated with polyunsaturated fats.,yes,Replacing saturated fats more often with unsaturated fats probably reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.
61,Is a vegetarian diet including eggs and dairy products healthier than a diet that includes meat?,"Lower heart and cancer risk Studies that vegetarians and non-vegetarians have observed over several years show a clear trend: In the group that eats meatless, heart attacks and cancer are rarer than in those who also have meat on the menu [1] [2]. According to the summarized results of previous investigations, vegetarians no longer live as meat fans, but are healthier. The health benefit of the vegetarian lifestyle is that declared meat fans seem to have a slightly higher risk of cancer than people who consume little meat (see also the medical-transparent contribution to meat ). A slightly older study summary from 2011 comes to similar results: The rate of cardiac death in vegetarians is significantly lower than in those who also eat meat. However, both analyses have one thing in common: the vegetarians studied as a whole did not live longer than people eating meat [1] [2].",yes,"People who eat a vegetarian diet do not seem to live longer than people who eat meat. However, it is possible that the meat-free diet causes them to develop cardiovascular diseases or cancer less frequently."
62,Can washing hands with antibacterial soaps or wash lotions containing triclosan or triclocarban prevent the risk of contracting diseases in the household?,"Antibacterial soaps: no better than normal soap However, washing with normal soap is quite enough. Even if manufacturers want us to believe it, many hand soaps or washing lotions marketed as ""antibacterial"" do not, as has been proven, reduce the risk of contagion with diseases in the normal population better than ordinary soaps. There is no scientific evidence that antibacterial soaps help better against the spread of diseases than normal soap. In neither of the two studies, the use of antibacterial soap resulted in more contagious diseases than conventional soaps. For the average household, however, it is very likely that antibacterial soaps do not better protect against diseases than ordinary hand soaps.",no,"Washing hands clearly protects against infections. However, those who use antibacterial soaps for this purpose are very unlikely to contract infectious diseases any less frequently than people who use conventional soap.

64,Does homeopathy work better than a placebo?,"Homeopathy no better than sham medication The summarized results of well-made studies show clearly that homeopathy remedies do not work better than active substance-less sham medications (placebos) [1]. Overall, there is no indication in previous studies that homeopathy could help in any disease or complaint better than placebo medications [1]. From this it can be concluded that the effect of homeopathy does not go beyond the placebo effect, so homeopathy has no specific efficacy. The authority comes to the conclusion that this is not the case, homeopathy does not work better than a sham medication.",no,The summarized results of previous studies show: There are no diseases or complaints for which homeopathy has been proven to help better than a placebo.
65,Does toothpaste containing xylitol reduce the risk of caries?,"Tooth-friendly sweetness with xylite In addition to good oral hygiene, the use of fluoride in tooth creams, for example, can help to strengthen the enamel and thus make it more resistant to caries.

67,Are paper towels or electric dryers more hygienic after washing hands?,"The significance of all studies was clearly limited, which was due to the concrete design, defects in the execution or evaluation. In some studies there were no significant differences between drying methods [2] [4] [5] [8], in others electric dryers cut better [3] [6] [7]. However, there is also a study in which the results are more likely to speak for paper towels [1]. Due to a number of shortcomings in the implementation, it is unclear whether some of these study results are more trustworthy than others. Based on the studies found, it is not possible to decide whether paper towels or electric dryers provide less germs of disease on the hands.",unknown,"Studies to date do not allow any clear conclusions to be drawn as to which method most reliably reduces the germ load on the hands. However, the number of studies is also rather poor, since the studies use very different methods and have various shortcomings.

Chocolate makes you happy – apples but also In a scientific review, a British psychologist and an Australian researcher have summarized studies on the effect of chocolate on the psyche [1]. In five out of six included studies, chocolate showed an improvement in mood. One study compared the effect of a chocolate snack with an apple: both improved the mood, but the effect of chocolate was stronger.",yes,"Chocolate actually contains many substances that can theoretically influence mood. However, they occur in concentrations that are too low for this. Nevertheless, the sweetness, the expectation and the ""overall package chocolate"" lead under certain circumstances to an - albeit short-term - improvement in mood."

Scientific studies that have investigated bud extracts or their allegedly disease-relieving effects simply do not exist. However, this does not explain how and why substances that grow plant cells are intended to promote human health.

New predictive tool in the test In a systematic review of studies on a total of just under 690,000 people, it emerged that an over-exploiting belly may indicate an increased risk of death [1]. Thus, a thick belly makes it more susceptible to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.",yes,"Current studies suggest that fat deposits in the abdomen (""visceral fat˝) may increase the risk of premature death. It is possible that individuals with unremarkable body mass index are also at risk. In the coming years, new studies will probably allow a better assessment."

Poor study quality Two other studies investigated how the uptake of pure choline in the form of food additives affects brain performance. However, the significance of the two studies is limited: only very few subjects had taken part in the methodologically poor studies. However, this result cannot be transferred to people with normal diets: with daily food, most of us absorb at least moderate amounts of choline. Conclusion: great uncertainty Overall, a memory-promoting effect of choline or lecithin from food cannot be reliably demonstrated.",unknown,Studies conducted to date provide no clear indication of whether supplemental intake of choline leads to improved memory in healthy people or in people with dementia who are not choline deficient.
78,Does white sugar cause cancer?,"However, this does not mean that sugar in itself is a direct risk factor and causes cancer. Despite already extensive research, the exact role sugar plays and whether it represents an additional risk, apart from its contribution to the calorie balance, has to be examined even better and more comprehensively. However, not all the causes have yet been clarified and above all, coincidence seems to play a major role: ""For many tumors, random errors in cell division are responsible, which cannot be prevented,"" says the German Cancer Research Center. Overall, there is no scientific evidence that sugar significantly affects the risk of cancer. The studies therefore do not allow a statement as to whether a sugary diet can cause cancer.",unknown,"Studies on white sugar cannot be found, but a link between sugar in general and cancer has also not been established."

The dietary supplement MSM is also intended to help osteoarthritis afflicted. However, there may be some effects, although the study situation is still somewhat poor. • There are some indications in the statistics of these studies that MSM can help with certain joint problems. Perhaps MSM is only suitable for certain groups of people, or it is more effective in combination with other means.",yes,"There are indications of a possible positive effect of MSM in osteoarthritis.

81,"Is wheat lectin, which is found in high amounts especially in whole wheat, harmful to health?","Although there is so far no evidence of the danger of wheat lecithin, which has been part of our diet for millennia, it is claimed via the Internet and the media that it could not only cause intestinal damage in humans. However, for a causal relationship to these diseases there are no tangible indications [5]. Questions to the whole grain All in all, the information from the scientific literature is therefore rather unsatisfactory: the present studies in animals (in vivo) and cells in the test tube (in vitro) [4] do not provide a basis for alarming. Our conclusion Based on the current study situation, a waiver of wheat whole grain products does not seem to make sense. At present, a risk from wheat lecithin is simply not tangible – quite in contrast to the advantages of a balanced diet that contains a lot of whole grain.",no,"There are no well-done long-term observations on healthy people from the general population. Therefore, there is a lack of robust data on the benefits and risks of a long-term diet without wheat lectin or whole wheat. However, that a varied diet with whole grains containing lectin protects against some diseases is relatively well established."
82,Is it harmful to health to regularly eat large quantities of fish contaminated with dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)?,"Harmfulness little researched In the calculations, however, there is a large unknown: to date, only little research has been carried out into the amounts of dioxins that actually lead to health damage. However, these are only partially transferable to humans. Overall, it remains unclear from what amount of PCBs and dioxins in fish become hazardous to health. However, it is unclear from which levels of dioxin or PCBs are expected to have health consequences. Again, it remains unclear how high the amount of PCBs in fish would have to be in order to increase the risk.",unknown,"Salmon and other river and ocean fish often contain traces of toxic dioxins and PCBs. However, too little research has been done to determine whether the amount of these toxins in regular fish consumption is sufficient to endanger health."
83,Is the DMPS test suitable to reliably indicate mercury poisoning?,"Not approved, but with risks Given the quality deficiencies, it is not surprising that the DMPS test is not allowed to detect mercury poisoning. In any case, we could not find any work convincingly explaining the advantages of a DMPS test for people with unspecific complaints. Conclusion: not recommended for diagnosis A DMPS test is expensive, can cause side effects, and its results are not clearly classified. All in all, the DMPS test for the detection of mercury poisoning does not appear to be recommended; the test does not seem to provide any health benefits. Mercury insecurity The popularity of the DMPS test, despite the lack of studies, may have to do with the increased sensitivity of the population to mercury.",unknown,"There are currently no well-done studies with reliable statements on the subject. So it remains open whether the DMPS test really benefits people who suspect heavy metal poisoning. However, risks of DMPS are known. All in all, this diagnostic tool therefore does not appear to be recommendable."
84,Can stevia lower high blood pressure?,"Although this trend was observed in a systematic review, the effect was very small [5]. We found a systematic review of the effect of blood pressure lowering. Due to the blood pressure lowering effect, people with low blood pressure should be careful with the sweetener.",yes,"With all foods, ""the dose makes the poison"". As a sugar-free sweetener, substances from the stevia plant do not promote tooth decay and have no calories. A medical benefit beyond that may be an effectiveness against high blood pressure."
85,Is eating genetically modified corn a health concern?,"Unexplored hazards for humans Whether genetically modified maize varieties can pose a potential health risk for humans is still little researched. Little meaningful On closer examination, however, these abnormalities proved to be of little significance, since they could have occurred by chance. In any case, there is no concrete evidence of a noticeable toxicity of genetically modified maize plants for humans in scientific literature – with a share of 70% of all maize plants grown in the USA. [6] Nevertheless, there are no investigations to exclude possible rare long-term effects in humans – after all, a human being differs significantly from a rat in several characteristics.",unknown,Several feeding studies in rats over short periods of time provide no clear indications of a health concern for various genetically modified corn varieties Whether side effects may occur over a longer period of time cannot be answered due to the lack of conclusive long-term studies in humans.
86,Are privately performed IgG tests to clarify food intolerances meaningful?,"However, the risk of shortages Experts, especially of allergology, warn against such tests: They point out that so far there has been no clear evidence of food intolerances caused by IgG. Basic problems All studies have a fundamental problem: the patients in the treatment and control group ate different foods. This does not make it clear whether a possible improvement of the complaints is actually due to IgG testing or rather to the choice of food. A benefit of the IgG tests can therefore also not be conclusively demonstrated by the studies in persons with intestinal diseases. Since the study lasted only four weeks, it is not possible to draw conclusions about longer-term results.",unknown,Whether elevated levels of immunoglobulin G in the blood are actually signs of intolerance to certain foods is highly controversial. Studies in which people with intestinal diseases avoid specific foods provide no clear evidence of benefit.
87,Is a gluten-free diet recommended for people who do not have celiac disease?,"Whether gluten itself does not actually cause digestive problems, if one does not suffer from celiac disease, has to be examined better in larger studies. Hardly surprising, there are no solid long-term studies on healthy individuals on the risks of a gluten-free diet. Currently, there are no convincing studies that argue for the absence of gluten by healthy people. So we currently do not know whether a gluten-free diet has long-term advantages. Overall, the studies conducted so far on gluten-free nutrition in people without celiac disease are not meaningful.",unknown,"There are no well-done studies that have investigated gluten abstinence in people who do not suffer from the autoimmune disease celiac disease. Therefore, there is a lack of reliable data on the possible benefits of a long-term gluten-free diet in the general population. Equally poorly studied are any risks of this form of renunciation, which is so hip at the moment."
88,Does the plant substance nobiletin contained in mandarins protect against weight gain?,"Mandarin active substance for overweight laboratory mice No, most likely not: Nobiletin occurs mainly in the shell of mandarins. ...but no studies in humans The results of this animal study are not easily transferable to humans. Therefore, no evidence of the efficacy of the mandarin active substance can be made for humans until results have been obtained. Whether the study participants have also lost weight has not been investigated. The claim that mandarins can protect against obesity is not scientifically valid at the moment.",unknown,"In genetically modified laboratory mice, the additional administration of nobiletin to a high-fat and high-sugar diet appears to be able to prevent obesity. Such an effect has not yet been studied in humans."
89,Does consumption of dairy products in middle and advanced age protect against bone fractures?,"Milk and dairy products no protection against broken bones Healthy bones need calcium, and milk contains a lot of it. But the consumption of calcium-rich dairy products alone is not enough for strong bones. An analysis of all relevant studies up to 2010 speaks more clearly: The results indicate that dairy products have no influence on the probability of developing a fracture of the thigh neck at an age of over 40 years [1] A summary of those studies published until 2015 also comes to the same conclusion [1a].Nevertheless, it is still too early to provide clear evidence. However, it also indicates that dairy products are ineffective in preventing bone fractures [2]. Effect at a young age unclear Whether the consumption of dairy products in youth can influence the probability of bone fractures in old age is not sufficiently investigated at present.",no,Those who are 40 or older and consume a lot of dairy products do not seem to be able to reduce their risk of age-related bone fractures.
90,Is the milk of horn-bearing cows less rich in allergens and more easily tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals?,"In the above-mentioned doctoral thesis, the comparison of proteins in the milk of cows with and without horns is based only on a few exemplary samples – far too little and too imprecise to come to a durable statement. The author has not investigated whether milk-allergic persons actually react to one of the two types of milk with less complaints. Also that the milk of horned cows is better tolerated for lactose-intolerant people, the data of the doctoral thesis in no way show. In some respects, they are more stringent than bio-criteria, which are therefore exceeded in Demeter operations.",unknown,There is no well-done study that would provide conclusive scientific evidence to support these questions.
91,"Does daily flossing protect against tooth decay, periodontitis and tooth loss?","Study situation not sufficient for dental floss recommendation Although prayer mill-like repeated, the effectiveness of dental floss for dental health has in fact hardly been studied more closely so far. It is therefore not clear whether floss actually results in rare caries, gum inflammation or periodontitis or if the teeth are preserved longer. Whether the additional effort is worthwhile for people with healthy teeth and intact gums remains as open as the question of to what extent floss can help with severe inflammation of the gums. In fact, there is evidence that the correct cleaning technique with floss could be decisive for the success and avoidance of side effects: The lateral tooth surfaces should therefore be freed from tooth coverings by careful up-and-down movements [1] [2] [5]. The studies so far do not really help: because they have observed too few people over too short periods of time and are partly of poor quality, they do not provide sufficient basis for the general recommendation to use floss every day and from childhood onwards.",unknown,"It is possible that regular flossing of the interdental spaces can help with mild gingivitis. However, there are no good studies that investigate whether this has a preventive effect against inflammation in healthy gums. The effect on the development of plaque is unclear. There are no studies at all on the question of whether flossing leads to fewer cavities, periodontitis or tooth loss."
92,Do protein supplements help build muscle?,"Methodical Deficiencies Scratch in Significance However, the significance of the summarized study results is limited because only a few subjects had participated in the individual studies. The results also do not allow conclusions to be drawn on the effect of protein powders, drinks and bars. It is therefore unclear whether it must be the expensive protein powder or whether it is enough to eat more milk, yoghurt and co. According to the summarized results of previously published studies, however, it does not seem to matter whether older people take protein supplements in addition to muscle building training. Our question about the effectiveness of protein powders, beverages and bars cannot be answered for another reason.",unknown,"A lot of research is being done in the field. However, the studies often have methodological flaws and contradictory results. It is therefore currently unclear whether and in what form supplemental proteins can help on the way to a six-pack and biceps."
93,Does music therapy promote recovery from severe limitations of consciousness after severe brain injury?,"Effects of music therapy too little investigated In a detailed literature research, we have only been able to promote few relevant investigations to the surface. None of the studies found involved music as a single treatment for severe brain damage and unconsciousness. Most studies have had very few patients, have serious methodological deficiencies and do not answer the question whether the patients actually achieve significant and long-term improvements in consciousness through treatment. This makes it unclear whether the results are transferable to people who have been in a wake-up coma or minimal state of consciousness for a long time. In addition, it is unclear whether the results of the study can also be transferred to other forms of treatment such as playing familiar pieces of music.",unknown,"We have not found any high-quality studies that specifically investigate the effect of music therapy. Some scientists explored the influence of stimulation of the senses, in which acoustic stimuli are also used. However, since these studies followed only a few people over short periods of time and had many methodological problems, they do not allow us to draw any firm conclusions."
94,Can eating grapefruit in combination with some medications lead to harmful interactions?,"A whole range of different medicines should be able to have serious health consequences in combination with grapefruits – either as fruit or as juice. 85 medicines have been found, the effect of which may be influenced by the consumption of grapefruits. A list of medicines for which severe side effects have been observed or suspected in combination with grapefruit can be found at the end of this article. In some cases, the consumption of a single fruit or a glass of grapefruit juice appears to be sufficient, in other cases harmful overdoses were observed only after days or weeks of regular consumption. The thrombosis-promoting effect of ethinylestradiol, a main active substance of conventional contraceptive pills, is increased by grapefruits.",yes,"Yes, grapefruits can enhance the effects of some medications. However, the risk, type, and severity of side effects are only partially known, depend on the particular drug, and likely vary from person to person."
95,Can regular consumption of chocolate prevent cardiovascular disease?,"An analysis of long-term studies investigating the relationship between chocolate consumption and cardiovascular disease indicates a significantly reduced risk. In a period of eight to 16 years, regular chocolate consumption decreased the likelihood of developing a heart attack, stroke or related disease by about a third [1]. An overview of the results of individual studies to date showed a positive influence of flavonoid-rich chocolate and cocoa products on the blood pressure of study participants. Long-term effect unclear Short-term studies over a few weeks, which only examined the effect of chocolate, provide evidence that chocolate could at least temporarily lower too high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, albeit only to a very small extent.",yes,"It is possible, but by no means certain, that chocolate could reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease such as heart attack or stroke. However, the high proportion of sugar and fat in most types of chocolate could also have negative effects."
96,Is barley grass good for health?,"So once again, a real miracle cure... we've looked into whether there might be anything to the allegations, but we haven't found sufficient evidence. No effect proven In fact, the young barley plant contains numerous nutrients. Unfortunately, we could only find a single clinical study that specifically investigated the effectiveness of barley grass in humans – and this is very small with only 51 people [1]. However, due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the study, the results of the study are only partly meaningful anyway. The total number of participants is therefore too small to make a reliable statement about the effect or undesirable effects of the cereal extract.",unknown,Only one small study has tested barley grass extract in humans to date. Barley grass juice has not been studied. The foundations are lacking for a reliable statement.
97,Are diets with reduced carbohydrate content better for weight loss than other weight loss programs?,"However, there is no evidence that they work better than fat-reduced diets or programs that put on a balanced nutrient combination [1-4]. Therefore, it cannot be completely ruled out that individual studies have shown the effects of low-carb diets a little more positive than they actually were. In summary, the four overviews show very similar results: Low-carb diets are comparable to other diets, but more weight than with conventional weight loss programs can probably not be lost in the long term.",no,"There is much evidence to suggest that, in the case of obesity, low-carbohydrate diets lead to at least comparable weight loss over one to two years as fat-reduced diets or weight-loss programs with a balanced diet."
98,Does taking probiotics during pregnancy and early life protect children from atopic dermatitis?,"Protection in and after pregnancy The summarized results of previous studies show that probiotics may protect infants from neurodermatitis [1]. A recent study summary confirms previous results: For children whose mothers had taken several mixed probiotic strains, the preventive effect was even greater [4]. The fact that probiotics may have a preventive effect against the development of atopic eczema shows a meta-anlysis from 2012 [1]. According to the analysis, probiotics could reduce the risk of neurodermatitis by one fifth.",yes,"Current studies suggest that the intake of probiotics could counteract the development of atopic dermatitis. However, many questions about efficacy and intake remain unanswered."
99,Is Bulletproof Coffee recommended?,"Conclusion Published studies with human subjects who have dealt with the subject of Bulletproof Coffee are not available. It also lacks the basis to make statements about side effects and long-term safety of this food form. Thus it should not be quite easy to make various effects dingfest. Ingredients under the microscope We have not found any clinical studies on the effects of Bulletproof Coffee. However, there are still various unexplained aspects around these references.",unknown,"Bulletproof coffee is high in caffeine and fat. Is the hip breakfast substitute a kind of fitness potion? Or is it even harmful? Because there have been no studies on this coffee blend with human test subjects, we cannot make any reliable statements."
100,Do apples help with smoking cessation?,"However, it is open which ingredients of apples should take the pleasure of tormenting – scientific evidence for this claim is missing. However, apples do not appear in this context and in evidence-based recommendations [a], at least not as an aid. However, the effects are small, and whether the apple taste is responsible can only be speculated. On the other hand, it is not researched whether the apple really takes the appetite for the cigarette.",unknown,Apples contain numerous ingredients and rightly have the reputation of being a healthy snack. Whether they can help to give up cigarettes has not yet been investigated in studies.
101,Do products made from fenugreek seeds help you lose weight?,"However, the results do not indicate that an extract of plant seeds could help to reduce weight. It is therefore unclear whether fenugreek seeds are able to lower blood sugar both in the short term and over longer periods of time. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent fenugreek seeds can be helpful in weight loss. Whether the Fenulife product helps with weight loss can by no means be demonstrated by a study carried out for only three days. The result is sobering: no meaningful studies of high quality were found.",unknown,"We found only one study in which participants had not lost weight after six weeks. However, the study period is very short, the number of participants small and the quality mediocre. It therefore remains unclear whether fenugreek seeds can help lose weight in the longer term."
102,Does skipping breakfast increase heart attack risk?,"Obviously, therefore, the main reason for the increased risk of heart attacks was not to skip the morning meal, but overweight, diabetes, increased blood pressure, or too high cholesterol levels. Thus, it is unclear whether the omission of breakfast leads to overweight or excess weight leads to the omission of breakfast.",unknown,"There is no clear evidence that not eating breakfast could be a cause of obesity and, as a consequence, an increased risk of heart attack. It is possible, however, that it is primarily those people who are overweight and have a higher heart risk who forgo their morning meal."
103,Does wheat make you fat and sick?,"But even if all of these mechanisms were correctly described, this does not necessarily mean that wheat makes you sick – the interplay of all mechanisms is not known. Thus, the reduction of excess weight leads to health improvements, not the elimination of wheat.",unknown,There is no evidence in current studies that wheat has a special connection with obesity and its consequences. Attributing a special role to wheat seems implausible.
104,Do whole grains lower the likelihood of dying early?,"Against cancer, heart problems and diabetes The current study situation shows something else: Those who frequently resort to whole grains get less cancer or cardiovascular diseases, for example a heart attack [1–4]. Thus, people in whom whole grains play a major role in their daily diet seem to live longer and healthier. All four summaries come to the same conclusion: They show a clear correlation between a full-grain diet and a reduced chance of dying early. At least as far as the reduced risk of disease is concerned, the data show a robust dose-effect relationship: the more whole grains are eaten, the lower the risk of disease [6].",yes,People who eat whole grain products instead of foods made from refined flour are likely to live longer and probably have a lower risk of dying from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
105,"Does the consumption of dairy products promote mucus and diseases of the ear, nose and throat?","No correlation between milk consumption and laboratory values The results of studies published so far in a systematic review do not indicate that high milk consumption increases inflammation levels in the blood. However, the fact that the long-standing popular belief that cow's milk has a smearing effect is not likely to be confirmed by this, according to current knowledge.",unknown,There is no scientific evidence to prove that cow's milk causes mucus.
106,Does regular consumption of energy drinks harm heart health?,"Thus, energy drinks could potentially increase heart rate and blood pressure in the short term, but this is not the case in all studies. However, the fact that the energy drinks had caused death is not certain. There is no evidence that caffeine can cause cardiac arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation at moderate doses. Larger doses of energy drinks can cause, for example, heart turf, tremor, arousal and digestive problems.",unknown,This question is insufficiently researched. Larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to assess the heart risk from energy drinks.
107,Do light drinks promote obesity?,"However, the fact that sweeteners actually affect blood sugar and insulin levels has not been proven. The largest work, a summary analysis of three studies involving a total of 125,000 participants [7], comes to the opposite conclusion – light drinks should therefore reduce the weight slightly. No scientific evidence whether artificially sweetened lemonades promote the development of overweight is therefore not yet available.",unknown,"Several cohort studies show that people who frequently drink light drinks are more likely to be overweight. However, this does not prove that sweetener drinks make you fat. For it is equally conceivable that overweight people try to lose weight with light drinks. Whether they are successful in doing so is unclear."
108,Does coffee reduce the risk of dementia?,"Scientists from Finland even want to find out that regular coffee drinking may also keep the brain fresh in the long term, in which it protects against dementia [1] [2]. And in fact, the scientists were able to establish a positive connection, but this effect seems to be above all a question of the coffee dose: the mental decline occurred most rarely during the course of the study in people who drank an average of one or two cups a day. From the data from a total of eleven individual studies, the scientists concluded that people who consume a lot of caffeine had a reduced risk of dementia by about one-sixth (16%). Further studies are necessary There are indications that people who drink a moderate amount of coffee daily are less at risk of developing cognitive disorders in the long term.",yes,One to two cups of coffee a day may protect against mental decline in the long term. It should not be more than that. It is unclear where this effect comes from and whether other caffeinated beverages might also be protective.
109,Does sugar consumption increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of obesity?,"Soft drinks increase the risk of diabetes People with a preference for large amounts of sugar-containing sodas also suffer more frequently from diabetes. In their analyses, two research teams [1,2] were able to independently show that the more sugar the study participants consume in the form of soft drinks, the higher the probability of developing type 2 diabetes. It seems that daily consumption of sugared soft drinks can trigger diabetes over many years even if it does not make you fat. Sugar content of other foods with unclear influence The association with type 2 diabetes is relatively clear for soft drinks.",yes,"Sugar-containing soft drinks can - if consumed regularly - cause obesity. Obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. However, sugared soft drinks probably also increase the risk of diabetes independently of obesity."
110,Does a lower salt diet reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease?,"Whether the many salt in the food was really the reason for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be unquestionably clarified. The result: a low-salt diet seems to be able to actually reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. Those who reduce their salt consumption can reduce blood pressure in the medium term. Lowering the risk of consequential diseases caused by high blood pressure can help a diet that is poorer in salt.",yes,"A lower-salt diet has been shown to help reduce elevated blood pressure somewhat. It is possible, but not certain, that this reduces the likelihood of dying from a stroke or the consequences of narrowed heart vessels, such as a heart attack."
111,Is less eaten from red plates?,"The result: The test subjects who were served their pretzels on red plates accessed significantly less than participants with blue or white plates. In a second experiment, subjects also drank soft drinks in a larger amount of blue instead of red cups. As logical as this explanation may sound, the study does not yet provide scientific evidence that red plates really eat less. In both salty and sweet snacks, the participants gained less when they were lying on a red plate in front of them.",yes,"In two psychological experiments, participants were less likely to eat salty pretzels, popcorn or chocolate chips if they were served on red plates. It is unclear whether the effect lasts over a longer period of time."
112,Does red wine protect better against cardiovascular disease than white wine?,"However, they usually did not distinguish between white and red wine [1] [2] [3]. It can therefore not be proven that red wine protects particularly well against cardiovascular diseases. Thus, people who consume small amounts of alcohol daily seem to have a lower cardiovascular risk and live a little longer than strict non-drinkers [1] [2] [3] [4]. The result: For a moderate dose of eight to ten grams of pure alcohol per day, the overall mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease were lower than for non- or minor drinkers. The impact of the studies is limited Even if people who eat a glass of wine or beer daily live longer and healthier, this does not necessarily mean that alcoholic beverages are responsible.",unknown,"There is evidence that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against cardiovascular disease, but the effect is not well established. Whether this possibly protective effect is stronger with red wine than with white wine or other alcoholic beverages has not been sufficiently investigated."
113,Do azo food dyes cause attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity in children?,"Since 2010, the EU has committed manufacturers to label food with azo dyes ""May affect the activity and attention of children"". However, the summarized results of these and other previously published studies provide clear evidence that artificial food colours can cause attention and hyperactivity disorder (ADHS). Although the bright-colored dyes could be a partial cause of ADHD, there are certainly many other unknown triggers [5]. The studies in detail The fact that azo dyes could be responsible for behavioural abnormalities of children suggests a clean summary of previous studies [2]. Compared to children who continued to consume azo dyes, behavioural abnormalities decreased slightly.",yes,Some studies fuel the suspicion that azo dyes can exacerbate ADHD symptoms.
114,Does turmeric prevent or cure cancer?,"However, well-executed studies of this kind have so far been scarce. After 6 months of administration, the values did not differ between turmeric and dummy subjects. This makes it unclear whether any improvement observed is due to turmeric treatment or whether the health status of the study participants would have improved without turmeric.",unknown,Animal studies provide tentative evidence that turmeric can prevent or treat cancer. Whether turmeric has such an effect in humans cannot be assessed due to the low confidence level of a few studies conducted to date.
115,Does breastfeeding reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome?,"The scientists conclude that the risk of breastfed children is halved compared to un breastfed children [2]. However, the matter has a small catch: the studies analysed show a connection. The studies in detail The fact that breastfeeding reduces the risk of unexpected death of a baby is only moderately secure. However, this does not necessarily prove that breastfeeding is the reason for the lower risk of infant death.",yes,"Breastfeeding can possibly reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, but this is not entirely certain. Other factors can also reduce the risk."
116,"Do boron preparations such as borax, boric acid, or calcium fructoborate relieve pain associated with age-related joint wear (osteoarthritis)?",Even if their authors want to give a positive impression in their work – a critical look at the data shows that the Borax tablets could not alleviate arthrosis complaints among the participants. There is no evidence that borax or boric acid can actually improve the discomfort in people with worn joints. Those who suffer from chronic osteoarthritis pains and stiff joints and are hoping for relief through Borax should rely on more effective alternatives.,unknown,"The few studies on this are of poor quality and therefore not trustworthy. Moreover, there is no evidence that the human body needs boron at all."
117,Can glutamate in food cause intolerance symptoms?,"There are many case reports of an alleged glutamate hypersensitivity, but these can hardly be verified. But among the alleged glutamate-sensitive subjects there was no one who showed symptoms after all glutamate [3]. The available studies show that up to three grams of glutamate does not cause symptoms in a selected group of healthy individuals.",unknown,"There is no conclusive evidence that the consumption of glutamate triggers complaints. However, since studies conducted to date have shown deficiencies, it cannot be ruled out that there are isolated individuals who react sensitively to large amounts of glutamate."
118,Does the Orthopulse device accelerate the orthodontic correction of malocclusions?,"Little meaningful The three published studies [1-3] cannot convince: None of the studies actually investigates the entire duration of treatment, but only the speed of tooth movements in the correction phase of brace therapy. This does not make any sure statements about the reduction of the overall duration of treatment with which the manufacturer advertises. Theoretically, two effects of orthopulses would be conceivable: positive effects if the duration of treatment were shortened, or negative effects if conversion processes at the tooth root were accelerated. Thus, it is also questionable whether the faster treatment with the orthopulse device actually results from infrared therapy: In the control group, the teeth move on average by 0.44 mm per week, in the group with the orthopulse device on average by 1.27 mm per week.",unknown,Poorly done studies show that the device can accelerate tooth movement in the short term. Whether this reduces the overall treatment time has not yet been sufficiently proven. The methodological weaknesses of the studies also mean that the results are not very credible. Possible side effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated.
119,Is it harmful for the mental development of the unborn child if the mother regularly eats fish contaminated with mercury during pregnancy?,"For previous studies suggest that the consumption of larger amounts of mercury-containing fish could slightly affect the mental performance of the offspring [1, 2, 3]. The studies in detail The fact that methyl mercury can damage the brain of unborn children already in concentrations in which the pregnant mothers themselves do not notice any symptoms is beyond question [6]. In investigations into the Faroe Islands and New Zealand, the assumption was confirmed: expectant mothers with high mercury levels were given children, whose mental performance was on average slightly worse in later tests than that of unloaded mothers – the mercury levels of the mothers were mostly so high, because they had consumed large amounts of contaminated fish before and during pregnancy. Impact on the IQ Despite these contradictions, the consumption of contaminated fish seems to reduce the intelligence of the offspring measurable, although it is not yet clear how much. A research team at Harvard University calculated an average reduction in the intelligence ratio of 0.7 points for each micrograms of mercury in mother's hair [2] in the analysis of studies from the Faroe Islands, Seychelles and New Zealand.",yes,"Many commercially available types of edible fish are contaminated with traces of methyl mercury. There are indications that regular consumption of such mercury-containing fish during pregnancy can impair the brain development of unborn children and thus their later mental abilities. In contrast, consumption of fish low in mercury could promote brain development in the unborn."
120,Can the consumption of caffeine during pregnancy harm the unborn child?,"However, the study showed that it made no difference whether the participants drank around three cups of caffeine or decaffeinated coffee. On average, the weight of birth at birth was about the same, was similar in size and was not more frequently born too early even after the mother's caffeine consumption. Similar to the summary of the Cochrane overview work: In early pregnancy three cups of coffee daily would have no effect on birth weight, growth or premature birth [2].",unknown,There is insufficient evidence that moderate consumption of caffeinated beverages would have a negative impact on the child's development. Up to three cups of coffee a day does not appear to reduce the child's birth weight. Very large amounts of caffeine-containing beverages could possibly contribute to lower birth weight.
121,Are vegetables prepared in a microwave oven less healthy than those prepared in other ways?,"Recent studies see the matter more differentiated: Depending on the variety of vegetables and the exact type of preparation, the microwave can sometimes be better and sometimes worse suited than, for example, cooking [2-12]. In the worst case, if it is exaggerated with the duration and the number of watts, the corresponding food is less health-promoting, but in no way harmful to health. If there are health problems related to the microwave, then this is not because the microwave ingredients are destroyed or changed, but because it is simply too unhealthy to eat altogether. The week-long feeding with always several times warmed up in the microwave has not led to any signs of poisoning in the animals.",no,"How vegetables change during preparation is extremely variable. With any type of heating, ingredients can be lost or become more easily accessible. In sum, it cannot be said that preparation in the microwave is always a bad choice."
122,Can garlic extract reduce high blood pressure and thus the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"Two better performed randomised-controlled studies provide cautious evidence that garlic can lower too high blood pressure [1]. However, even the results of these two studies are insufficiently valid for a clear assessment [1]. Whether garlic taken regularly can lower too high blood pressure and thus lower the risk of cardiovascular disease remains unclear for the time being. At least in theory, there may also be interactions with anticoagulant drugs or side effects in persons with a tendency to bleed, as garlic is suspected to have an anticoagulant effect.",unknown,"Studies to date provide tentative evidence of a blood pressure-lowering effect of garlic. However, they are of too low quality to be able to prove a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease as a result of high blood pressure."
123,Can fructose damage the liver?,"Fruit sugar as a cause not proven There are no meaningful indications for the assumption that fruit sugar is responsible for the development of the liver disease [1]. In other words, for the liver, it may not matter what kind of sugar you eat.",unknown,There is no conclusive evidence for a possible liver-damaging effect of fructose.
124,Can green tea affect the likelihood of dying early and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"In fact, the summarized results of observational studies show that passionate green tea drinkers live longer on average – apparently because they are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack [2,3]. However, a 100% proven cause-effect relationship à la ‘Green tea use protects against stroke, heart attack and co' cannot be derived from these observational studies. We do not know exactly what the substances from the green tea in our body do – and what amounts can trigger a positive health effect. Overall, the study data show that passionate green tea drinkers are less likely to die from cardiovascular diseases and thus live longer overall. Seven RCTs are summarized here, and the authors concluded that green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement may have a beneficial influence on the risk factors of blood pressure, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.",yes,"There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
125,Is matcha tea particularly healthy?,"No recommendations, no warnings Due to the current study situation, it is therefore not possible to make specific recommendations for tea consumption. The studies in detail Matcha is the trend for many consumers, but in scientific literature this special green tea hardly exists.",unknown,"There is a lack of conclusive studies on the health effects of specific matcha. However, there is some evidence that green tea in general may reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely, especially from cardiovascular disease."
126,Can acupuncture prevent migraines and tension headaches?,"Acupuncture works... From chronic migraines or tension headaches Affected patients get significantly rare headache attacks when they not only take conventional medication, but also undergo prophylactic acupuncture treatment. ...but as good as migraine medications Another point suggests that acupuncture has a valuable prophylactic effect – at least for migraine sufferers: Further studies showed that acupuncture can only partially prevent migraine attacks, but at least as well as common medications [1].",yes,"In the case of migraine, the preventive effect of acupuncture is probably similar to that of prophylactic medication. However, for both migraine and tension headaches, acupuncture performs only slightly better than sham acupuncture. Whether the pricking of traditional acupuncture points plays a role is unclear."
127,Can green tea reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer ?,"In some studies, there was indeed a slightly reduced probability of disease, but other studies even suggested an increased risk of cancer from the use of green tea. The result provides sobering clarity: people who regularly drink large amounts of green tea die in sum as often at some kind of cancer as people who hardly touch green tea [8]. To a degree harmless Although the benefits of green tea against cancer are questionable, there is no evidence of a health-impairing effect in moderate consumption of some cups a day [2].",no,The results of previous studies suggest that green tea cannot reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
128,Can plant sterols or foods with them reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"However, it is unclear whether the intake of such high amounts of plant sterols – e.g. Whether these results are a coincidence or whether the higher rate of cardiovascular problems are actually due to plant sterols and not to other causes is unclear. Cholesterol is also different Whether plant sterols can actually reduce not only LDL cholesterol levels, but also the risk of cardiovascular diseases, has not been investigated in a single clinical study.",unknown,"Plant sterols do lower cholesterol levels. However, whether they also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has not been researched. Animal studies even provide evidence that plant sterols in large quantities could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Whether this also applies to humans has not been investigated."
129,Can too much iodine cause autoimmune thyroid disease and consequently hypothyroidism?,"Individual studies suggest that too large amounts of iodine may be responsible. Probably a variety of causes These study results suggest that Hashimoto disease is more likely to occur in people with particularly high iodine consumption. However, large amounts of iodine may cause serious disturbances in people with potentially undetected thyroid problems [8]. The studies in detail Whether large amounts of iodine can actually cause inflammation of the thyroid gland by an overreacting immune system is not well protected. The result: the higher the iodine intake in a region, the greater the proportion of residents who suffer from autoimmune thyroid inflammation.",yes,Autoimmune thyroid disease appears to occur more frequently in individuals with high iodine consumption. Whether high levels of iodine actually cause this disease has not been conclusively determined.
130,Is the sweetener aspartame harmful to health?,"The result: the sweetener is in all probability safe. Safety levels Based on the results of numerous studies in laboratory animals and humans, the scientists established a safety limit for aspartame. Thus, every person can take 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight every day for the rest of his life without fear of health consequences. Even those who exceed this amount will not suffer any health hazard.",no,"Health damage from aspartame is unlikely. This also applies to people who consume aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages in large quantities over a long period of time. However, in people suffering from the hereditary disease phenylketonuria (PKU), aspartame can cause nerve and brain damage."
131,Does coffee affect cancer death risk?,"Both studies concluded that coffee consumption has no effect on cancer mortality. In other words, coffee generally does not seem to favor or prevent death through cancer. For breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer there seems to be no association with the consumption of coffee. Conclusion: Coffee consumption does not seem to affect cancer mortality. They did not detect any influence of coffee on the number of cancer deaths.",no,Current evidence suggests that coffee consumption in general is neither protective nor detrimental to cancer death risk.
132,Do diets with primarily or exclusively uncooked foods have health benefits?,"Whether raw food followers suffer a heart attack or stroke less often, need less medication or live longer overall, can not be derived from this. Conclusion A health benefit of raw food, which goes beyond an increased consumption of vegetable foods, has not been conclusively proven. Rather, there are indications that strict raw food diets may also have a negative impact on health – similar to other diets that severely restrict food selection.",unknown,"In studies, we have not been able to find convincing evidence that raw foods provide health benefits over healthy diets that include cooked foods. On the contrary, there is also evidence of possible harm."
133,Can increased water consumption prevent migraines or other headaches?,"Preventive effect of water unclear In 2011, Dutch researchers published a study [1] according to which drinking an additional one and a half liters of water per day could significantly relieve headaches. Until strict clinical studies with a larger number of patients have been conducted, the effectiveness of increased water consumption cannot really be assessed. However, if increased drinking can actually prevent headaches, the effect may not be particularly large.",unknown,"Whether drinking more water can prevent headaches cannot be answered satisfactorily on the basis of studies conducted to date. If there is an effect, however, it is likely to be very small."
134,"Offer the following herbal appetite suppressants effective and safe weight loss support:
Devil's Tongue (Konjac Root), Caralluma fimbriata, Garcinia cambogia, Gymnea sylvestre, Ephedra, Irvinia gabonensis, Fenugreek, Hoodia gordonii, Common Bean, Bitter Orange?","Overall, for the authors of this systematic survey, it remains questionable whether the investigated plant extracts can help with long-term weight loss and are also safe. [12] So there is no good evidence that at least the food supplements listed here can provide significant support in weight loss.",unknown,"Due to the number of studies, it is unclear for a number of supposedly appetite-suppressing dietary supplements whether they can support successful weight loss. Well-done studies that run over a long period of time with a sufficient number of test subjects are scarce. Evidence for long-term safety and simultaneous efficacy is therefore lacking."
135,Are there health benefits to screening the general population for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a precaution?,"Recommendation against COPD screening The answer may surprise: such a precautionary examination does not bring any discernible health benefit. If you don't have any symptoms yet and only learns about a COPD due to the screening, you may not have any benefit at all [1,2]. Here, too, a population-wide COPD early detection does not bring any health benefit.",no,Even people with moderately severe COPD may have little health benefit from starting treatment as early as possible. People without symptoms who are diagnosed with COPD only as a result of a screening test are therefore unlikely to gain much health benefit from drug treatment.
136,Can cow's milk cause iron deficiency in babies in the first year of life?,"Moreover, the infant can use iron from cow's milk much worse, because among other things the calcium and casein contained in it inhibits the absorption of iron. Babies actually seem to suffer more from iron deficiency when they are fed cow's milk early on. Only as far as iron deficiency is concerned, statements are possible: Seven out of eight studies suggest that early use of cow's milk in babies significantly increases the risk of iron deficiency.",yes,"Cow's milk is low in usable iron. Therefore, cow's milk appears to increase the likelihood of iron deficiency in the blood of babies. It is unclear whether animal milk increases the risk of type 1 diabetes or blood in the stool, or reduces the likelihood of allergic diseases."
137,Does cow's milk for babies have other health disadvantages??,Other health consequences are unclear There are many conjectures about the health effects of cow's milk in infanthood. The studies in detail The study situation regarding the health effects of cow's milk in babies is poor.,unknown,"Cow's milk is low in usable iron. Therefore, cow's milk appears to increase the likelihood of iron deficiency in the blood of babies. It is unclear whether animal milk increases the risk of type 1 diabetes or blood in the stool, or reduces the likelihood of allergic diseases."
138,Does drinking breast milk as a baby have a positive effect on later health and development?,"In any case, it is proven that this form of nutrition has certain health benefits – such as a lower risk for some infectious diseases in infanthood [2] [4] [9] and the sudden death of children, as we have reported here. In later life, the risk of obesity is somewhat reduced [5.6],the IQ of breastfeeding children seems to be a few points higher [7]. In summary, the authors believe that drinking breast milk does not produce any practical benefits. For example, breastfeeding may help reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer in children [4] [8,9].",yes,"It is possible that children who have been exclusively breastfed for a long time are somewhat less likely to become overweight later on. There is also evidence that their IQ is slightly higher. However, it is difficult to isolate the influence of breast milk drinking. Therefore, it is questionable what significance the effects found have in practice."
139,Does Almased help with excess weight better than other diets?,"None of the studies found uses a meaningful control group. Of course, someone with Almased can lose weight – as with any other way to reduce calories as well. The studies do not show whether Almased is better than a sip of water, honeybread or any other diet product.",unknown,"Those who reduce their calorie intake with the help of Almased lose weight. However, whether the product facilitates a diet or works better than other diets is not sufficiently studied."
140,"Do products with talc, such as baby powder, increase the risk of ovarian cancer?","Since cohort studies, as described above, are more meaningful than case-control studies, we could claim that the study situation would speak against an increased risk. Conclusion In order to be on the safe side, despite the higher-quality cohort studies that speak against a risk, we consider the risk to be unclear.",unknown,"Basically, cohort studies are more informative than case-control studies. The two existing large cohort studies speak against an increased risk, almost all case-control studies for an increased risk. In order not to underestimate a possible risk, we assess the study situation as unclear despite the cohort studies."
141,"Do large portions, large plates or glasses, and larger packaging cause us to eat and drink more?","If you get larger portions served, you probably eat more than if the portion had been smaller. Large portions affect everyone On average, large portions tempt us adults to eat about 250 calories more than would be the case with smaller portions. Although the individual studies are largely of unclear or poor methodological quality, they all show consistent in one direction: larger portions encourage people to eat more and possibly drink more.",yes,"The results of previous studies show that people generally seem to eat more and drink more (non-alcoholic) beverages when they are served larger portions. Whether smaller portions prevent obesity in the long term, however, has not been researched."
142,Does taking coconut oil improve mental abilities in dementia like Alzheimer's disease?,"Although a recent summary of studies could not definitely confirm the relationship [4], it is recommended for patients at increased risk to consume less saturated fatty acids [5]. However, since the study has some methodological weaknesses, included only a few patients and is only a snapshot at a single point in time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from this study [7]. Coconut oil poorly studied in Alzheimer's disease A company in the USA markets a component of coconut oil (caprylids) as a medical food for Alzheimer's disease. Since the symptoms in Alzheimer's can improve for a short time, it is not possible to distinguish with the before-after examination whether the observed change is actually caused by the coconut oil or not by other factors.",unknown,We could find only one clinical study on the use of coconut oil in Alzheimer's disease. This was of such poor quality that no firm statement is possible.
143,"Does the preparation ""CAPS immu"" from Ringana reduce the risk of infections in healthy people?","Scientific evidence for an immune-enhancing effect of the mixture is missing. For the calcareous algae and the various fungi, we could not identify any studies that deal with the prevention of common infections in otherwise healthy people. However, this does not allow safe conclusions as to whether this actually reduces the risk of infection or makes other health problems less common. Conversely, it cannot be deduced that the increased intake strengthens the immune system and leads to less colds. Preventive intake did not reduce the risk of a cold in the normal population.",unknown,Neither for the preparation itself nor for the individual components has such an effect been proven in clinical studies according to our research.
144,Do extracts from grape seeds have a health-promoting effect?,"In fact, there are a lot of studies with animals and cell cultures bred in the laboratory that suggest a potential efficacy of grape seed extract. Based on studies conducted so far with humans, we cannot assess whether the extract has an effect. In addition to the poor quality of most studies, contradictory results make a sound assessment of effectiveness difficult.",unknown,The quality of studies available to date is too poor and the results are too contradictory to assess whether grape seed extract has a health-promoting effect.
145,Is the administration of magnesium through the skin effective?,"Our conclusion Our research on transdermal magnesium in winter 2015 revealed that we do not know whether it is useful to administer magnesium via the skin and whether the quantity element can become effective after such administration within the body. We could not find a good indication of the symptoms in which such an application might be useful and which forms might be most suitable for administration (spray, foot bath, etc.). For these reasons, we cannot make any statements about side effects and long-term safety of treandermal magnesium. [3] The studies in detail On the subject of ""transdermal magnesium therapy"", we have found two quite recent, albeit not particularly meaningful, studies with human subjects. No reliable conclusions are possible However, the reasonably positive results of this pilot study are to be interpreted with great caution: It is not possible, for example, to conclude from the possible effects in fibromyalgia patients on the general population or other patient groups.",unknown,"There are no well-done studies on this subject. Therefore, we lack reliable information as to whether or in what form magnesium can possibly penetrate the skin and then also have a (desired) effect."
146,Do kava kava supplements help with anxiety disorders?,"Only partially helpful Even with regard to the fear-relieving effect, so far published study results on Kava-Kava do not convince [1] [2]. Thus the preparations from the South Sea plant may be able to help with fears in the short term, but their effect seems to be very modest and is not well documented. However, the potentially dangerous side effects do not allow Kava-Kava to treat anxiety conditions anyway – even if the other side effects such as headache, drowsiness and fatigue sound relatively acceptable [10]. Their results suggest that Kava-Kava can alleviate the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.",yes,"The fact that kava kava may slightly alleviate symptoms of an anxiety disorder is only weakly supported by studies. In addition, several cases of severe liver damage from preparations made from it are known in Europe and the USA."
147,Do ultrasound devices help against dust mites?,"Unfortunately, no, because the evidence that the device works is missing and whether the ultrasound does anything at all is also doubted by an expert. Unpublished Although studies are actually reported on the website of a manufacturer [a], three of them are published only as short summaries at conferences. These summaries contain too little information to verify the validity of the studies. The fourth work also lacks both precise information on the method and on the statistical evaluation of the results.",unknown,"Only dubiously published studies exist, the quality and significance of which cannot be assessed. Consequently, the effectiveness of the ultrasound devices is unclear."
148,"Does the risk of food allergy decrease if babies are fed potentially allergenic foods (cow's milk, peanuts, chicken egg) as late as possible for the first time?","The early feeding of baby-appropriately prepared peanuts seems to have reduced the risk of allergy. If children in a study already received these foods at the age of three months, they did not have a higher risk of food allergy than children who were only fed at the age of six months [3]. If a woman tries to avoid theoretically allergic foods during pregnancy or breast-feeding, this does not seem to reduce her child's allergy risk [6]. Whether the risk of allergies even decreases if babies are fed appropriate foods as early as possible is unclear for most foods. According to another review, three further studies show that early contact with cow's milk is unlikely to make infants more susceptible to milk allergy [5].",no,"in none of the clinical studies to date has the risk of food allergy decreased by feeding these foods as late as possible. Whether early supplementary feeding can reduce the risk is less clear, but possible at least for peanut allergy. For fish, sesame and wheat, there is only one study, the results of which need to be confirmed in further studies."
149,"for fish, sesame, wheat?","If children in a study already received these foods at the age of three months, they did not have a higher risk of food allergy than children who were only fed at the age of six months [3]. For the remaining three foods, fish, sesame and wheat, the scientists also found no increased likelihood of food allergy [3].",no,"in none of the clinical studies to date has the risk of food allergy decreased by feeding these foods as late as possible. Whether early supplementary feeding can reduce the risk is less clear, but possible at least for peanut allergy. For fish, sesame and wheat, there is only one study, the results of which need to be confirmed in further studies."
150,"Can willow bark tea help with inflammation, pain or fever?","Only traditions Scientific evidence of whether drinking willow bark tea actually has a pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory or antipyretic effect is missing. There are no well-executed studies comparing the active ingredients of the willow bark with acetylsalicylic acid or other painkillers. It remains completely unclear over which time period and at what dose willow bark tea should be taken. It is of concern that there are no reliable studies on the possible harmful effects of willow bark [1] [4] [5]. The authors of both studies came to the conclusion that the study situation on the efficacy of willow bark is completely unclear and that the results of the existing studies do not provide any serious conclusions.",unknown,"Significant, well-conducted studies are lacking on the effects of willow bark tea on pain, inflammation, or fever."
151,"Can a supposedly ""high acid"" diet weaken bones?","However, a more acidic urine does not say anything about the blood pH, and above all is not related to a possible ""acidification"" of the body, as the representatives of the basic nutrition theory claim. It was shown that a so-called acid-emphasized diet (for example, a high-phosphate, high-protein or high-cereal) has no negative effects on the bones. Although the risk of fractures was not directly investigated, there was no evidence of a decrease in bone density.",no,"It is not likely that a supposedly ""acid-rich"" diet weakens the bones. There are no scientific studies on the effect on other diseases."
152,"Does a supposedly ""alkaline-rich"" diet prevent chronic diseases?","However, scientific studies investigating such a link between acidic or basal nutrition and the state of health have hardly been carried out. Benefits of a basic diet questionable Overall, the benefits of a basic diet are questionable. The additional base powder or other ""base-promoting"" food supplements, which are praised by representatives of the base theory, do not bring any expected benefits.",unknown,"It is not likely that a supposedly ""acid-rich"" diet weakens the bones. There are no scientific studies on the effect on other diseases."
153,Can a blood test detect mental illness?,"Psychological Tests for Psychological Diseases We have not found any psychological disease that is diagnosed with blood tests. However, this does not mean that, in reverse, blood tests reliably reveal mental illnesses to us.",unknown,"Stress can certainly affect blood values, but conversely, we are not aware of any blood test that is actually useful for diagnosing mental illness."
154,Is surgery for an anterior cruciate ligament tear (by replacing the broken anterior cruciate ligament with tendon tissue from another part of the leg) followed by physical therapy better than physical therapy alone?,"Minor differences and later surgery According to the study, both treatment strategies are similarly successful. In the subsequent control tests, patients assessed mobility, pain and resilience in both groups about the same way.",no,"No differences are found between the two treatment methods after either two or five years. However, this should be viewed with great caution. In a study on this, many patients in the group with physiotherapy had surgery after all within the next five years."
155,Can motherwort reduce migraine attacks?,"In the best case, mother's wort reduces the number of migraine attacks slightly more frequently than a dummy preparation (placebo) can do: On average, the study participants had about five migraine attacks a month, they regularly took mother's wort, it was only just under three. However: Also a dummy preparation leads to an improvement, smotherwort only works a little better – it reduces 0.6 attacks more per month than the dummy medicine [1]. Mother's wort may reduce the number of attacks, but it has no effect on how severe the pain in the attacks is or how long they last.",yes,"The existing studies differ greatly in their methods and the results are sometimes contradictory. According to the study with the most participants, motherwort can slightly reduce the number of migraine attacks per month."
156,Does metal in bed disturb sleep?,"Our conclusion We cannot deduce from the current study situation that people who sleep in metal bed frames may have negative health consequences. More unlikely: Metal damage We cannot answer another detail question about the electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic fields typically present at home. We do not know whether these fields can be influenced by (some) metals in the bed frame in such a way that they can cause negative health consequences. All in all, it does not seem particularly plausible at the moment that metal bed racks present a health risk.",unknown,"Again and again consumers hear that bedsteads made of certain metals or with metal parts are harmful to health. But scientific studies on this are lacking. For this reason, we cannot say whether metal beds change the electrosmog exposure and thus perhaps even have a negative impact on health. From today's point of view, however, a clear danger does not seem particularly likely."
157,Does heat treatment (radiofrequency ablation or radiofrequency heat ablation of benign nodules of the thyroid gland work as well as conventional surgical methods?,"However, after the heat treatment, the nodes were not observed long enough to tell if they actually disappeared completely. They cannot answer whether the heat treatment works just as well as the old surgical technique. The studies in detail We couldn't find any well-managed, meaningful studies that investigate the effectiveness of radio frequency ablation. They conclude that the current scientific evidence is insufficient to compare the effectiveness and safety of radiofrequency ablation in benign thyroid tumours with that of standard surgery.",unknown,It is currently not clear whether this method achieves the same success as conventional surgical methods. The quality of the studies found is poor and leaves many questions about the effectiveness of the method unanswered. Possible undesirable side effects and long-term consequences are also unknown.
158,Does Imunoglukan strengthen the immune system?,"So if there is any effect of imunoglucane at all, it is not clear whether the vitamin C or the ß-glucan from the fungus. For imunoglucane no effect can currently be considered to have been demonstrated. The study has no significance.",unknown,"There are no studies that attest to Imunoglukan having a specific effect on a specific disease, nor any that confirm a general immune-boosting effect. The existing studies have glaring deficiencies."
159,Do cell phones promote the development and growth of tumors in the head?,"But even after more than 20 years of mobile phone use and research, there are no clear answers. Conclusion Despite in-depth research, the studies are not convincing. Even if mobile phones increase the risk of cancer, the risk increase is minimal: in absolute terms, the risk increases from 0.0072 percent to 0.0096 percent.",unknown,"Despite intensive research, it is currently still unclear whether cell phones promote tumor diseases. According to current knowledge, the risk increases only minimally, if at all."
160,Does wearing bras promote breast cancer risk?,"According to the summary and, above all, according to some pages on the Internet, the study shows that women who wear bras have a double risk of breast cancer than those who do not wear bras. In sum, the study shows that wearing bras has no influence on the risk of breast cancer. Therefore, a comparison of the risk of breast cancer between bra carriers and women who do not wear bra is not possible with this study.",unknown,"The extent to which wearing bras affects breast cancer risk is poorly understood. So far, results of case-control studies tend to argue against a risk from bras, and there is no serious evidence that bras increase the risk."
161,Are tattoo inks harmful to health?,"Unknown danger Although it is known for many ingredients that they are carcinogenic or can cause allergies, there are virtually no studies on the long-term health consequences. Where else the dyes in the body get, and whether they are an additional health risk, is also hardly researched. A reliable test to check the allergy risk of tattoo inks is not yet available [2]. The studies in detail There are no meaningful studies on the safety of tattoo colours.",unknown,Many tattoo inks contain substances that are harmful to health. Which colors can be used for tattoos without health concerns is unclear. There are no studies that investigate the risk.
162,Do plant hormones (phytoestrogens) other than genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause?,"It is therefore questionable whether and from what dose or duration of therapy they can produce a noticeable effect at all. Based on the current and sometimes contradictory study situation, it is not possible to say whether phytoestrogenic hot flashes and sweat eruptions can make less frequent or mitigate their intensity. The study situation for phytoestrogens is therefore unclear. However, there are no known major health risks associated with short-term intake.",unknown,"It is unclear whether phytoestrogens can help with hot flashes. Studies on this topic are often of modest quality; usually a comparison of the data is not possible. Therefore, an overall judgment cannot be made. One exception is the phytoestrogen genistein. There are indications that this plant substance in higher doses may be able to reduce the number of daily hot flashes a little."
163,Does the herbal hormone genistein reduce the number and intensity of hot flashes during menopause???,However: Genistein – which is a phytoestrogen from the group of isoflavones – may have a beneficial effect on the frequency of hot flashes at higher doses. There was indeed a certain positive effect here: the frequency of hot flashes was reduced.,yes,"It is unclear whether phytoestrogens can help with hot flashes. Studies on this topic are often of modest quality; usually a comparison of the data is not possible. Therefore, an overall judgment cannot be made. One exception is the phytoestrogen genistein. There are indications that this plant substance in higher doses may be able to reduce the number of daily hot flashes a little."
164,Does bloodletting according to Hildegard von Bingen have health benefits?,"Hildegard's Nonsense On the one hand, the bloodletting is based on ignorance of the blood circulation and on the other hand on the ancient four-scent doctrine: In this over 2000-year-old theory, a balance of body juices blood, yellow bile, black bile and mucus was of great importance and with a bloodletting this balance could be influenced. Medicine according to Hildegard von Bingen is a marketing invention from the 20th century. But after unscientific ideas such as detox and acidification have kept to this day, neither does the bloodletting after Hildegard von Bingen die out.",unknown,"Traditional bloodletting is based on ideas that have long been disproved and is not the subject of studies. However, in the case of very specific blood diseases, bloodletting is also used in scientific medicine."
165,Can FGXpress Power Strips reduce pain or improve wound healing?,"The pointless claim of detoxification and detoxification is also made. Many of the promises require studies: whether and in which cases pain can be reduced and which wounds can be better cured would have to be proven by a manufacturer in studies. To our knowledge, however, there is not a single study on FGXPress Power Strips. Although the manufacturer shows before/after images with a thermal camera, without accurate documentation and control by outsiders, this is completely worthless.",unknown,We could not find a single study on these patches - nor any reason to assume that they are effective.
166,Does treatment according to the fascial distortion model help with chronic shoulder pain?,"In the study, this form of fascia therapy shows advantages over classic treatment: the mobility of the shoulder is improved more, as is functionality. The most important criterion was how far the mobility of the shoulder can be improved: in the group treated according to fascia distortion model, mobility improved on average in patients by 30 percent in six weeks, in the comparison group only by 15 percent. Participants in the FDM group also performed significantly and clinically relevantly better in terms of functionality and strength.",yes,"Currently, there is only one randomized controlled trial of this type of therapy. It suggests that fascia therapy may help with some shoulder conditions."
167,Are there effective alternatives to the breathing mask (CPAP) for sleep apnea?,"The authors of an overview of 2013 see such interventions as a possible alternative for those patients who reject the breathing mask: During the day of fatigue they lead to a similar improvement as standard therapy, but they are not so good at reducing breath loss [2]. However, since the breath loss has a decisive influence on subsequent diseases, standard therapy is preferable if possible. Overall, oxygen therapy is significantly less helpful than CPAP [3]. Conclusion For patients who reject standard therapy with breathing mask, there are numerous other treatment options available – but these are not as effective in the decisive symptoms as CPAP.",no,"Although numerous other forms of treatment are available, some of them are too little researched or are clearly inferior to the standard therapy with CPAP."
168,Does closure of the foramen ovale prevent further strokes in people who have had a stroke of unknown cause?,"If such patients have a PFO, surgical closure can be used to prevent further strokes. Nevertheless, the data speak for the procedure; thus, even if the cause of the stroke is unknown, the risk of a further stroke can be reduced in at least those people who have an open foramen ovale. All three individual studies provide very similar results and indicate that the closure avoids another stroke rather than just anticoagulant therapy with medications.",yes,"According to three large studies, closure of the patent foramen ovale can prevent another stroke better than purely drug treatment can."
169,Does stimulation current therapy (TENS - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) help with worn knee joints (knee osteoarthritis)?,"Pain-absorbing effect questionable However, it is questionable that a large-scale electrical irritation of the skin's surface around the knee is sufficient. These are of too little quality and significance to get a clear picture of the pain-absorbing effect of TENS treatment. Lack of evidence for other types of pain TENS therapies are used not only in knee arthritis, but also in a number of other painful conditions. In combination with the results of Cochrane's work, however, it remains the case: even the whole of the studies does not allow an assessment of whether current therapy can improve pain in knee arthrosis.",unknown,"Whether TENS treatments can improve pain associated with knee osteoarthritis is unclear. In any case, it does not seem to be able to improve restrictions in everyday movements."
170,Does taking magnesium salts decrease the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps with unknown cause?,"Insufficient evidence The examination shows that the evidence of efficacy is rather meager: We have not found any high-quality studies that have investigated the effect of magnesium salts on exertive muscle spasms, for example in athletes. It is therefore unclear whether athletes benefit from the intake of magnesium supplements.",no,"No high-quality studies have been found on the efficacy of magnesium salts for exercise-induced muscle cramps, such as in athletes. For leg muscle cramps without an identifiable cause, researchers have been unable to demonstrate any effect of magnesium beyond placebo in studies. Pregnant women may benefit from magnesium supplements, but this evidence is not very robust."
171,Does taking magnesium salts reduce the frequency and intensity of exercise-induced muscle cramps during sports?,"Anyone suffering from nocturnal calf cramps without known cause will probably not feel relief from magnesium preparations [1] [2]. In muscle spasms without obvious cause, the symptoms were not easier and did not occur less frequently compared to placebo when participants had taken magnesium supplements. Accordingly, the authors also came to similar conclusions: no effect of magnesium salts was detectable in the general population compared to placebo.",unknown,"No high-quality studies have been found on the efficacy of magnesium salts for exercise-induced muscle cramps, such as in athletes. For leg muscle cramps without an identifiable cause, researchers have been unable to demonstrate any effect of magnesium beyond placebo in studies. Pregnant women may benefit from magnesium supplements, but this evidence is not very robust."
172,Does taking magnesium salts reduce the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps in pregnancy?,"Only in pregnant women a small effect is possible: Compared to placebo, women taking a magnesium preparation suffer an average of about one muscle cramp per week less. Pregnant women may be able to help relieve their calf cramps by taking a magnesium preparation. In pregnant women, the authors summarized the results: When taking a magnesium preparation, the women suffered about one seizure per week less than when taking a dummy preparation.",yes,"No high-quality studies have been found on the efficacy of magnesium salts for exercise-induced muscle cramps, such as in athletes. For leg muscle cramps without an identifiable cause, researchers have been unable to demonstrate any effect of magnesium beyond placebo in studies. Pregnant women may benefit from magnesium supplements, but this evidence is not very robust."
173,Does the active ingredient rivaroxaban (drug Xarelto) have a higher risk of dangerous bleeding than other anticoagulants?,"A summary analysis of studies published so far on rivaroxaban in particular also finds overall less fatal bleeding than in the use of vitamin K antagonists (cumarine) [4], although there has been no overall difference in the number of premature deaths. The comparison of rivaroxaban with other factor Xa inhibitors shows only very small differences: According to a recent summary of several meta-analyses, the active substance of Xarelto does not perform best, but the result is uncertain. Overall, these drugs have the same effect as the older vitamin K antagonist treatment, but with a significantly lower risk of bleeding – the risk is almost halved. According to this, the new drugs avoid strokes more effectively than the older ones, with regard to the risk of bleeding there is no difference.",no,"High-quality studies in the most common uses of rivaroxaban show either an equal or even lower risk of bleeding than other blood-clotting medications. However, this does not mean it is the best choice in all cases. Research is still needed for bleeding in the stomach or intestines."
174,Does vitamin D protect against dementia or memory loss?,"[5] [9] Even if, according to current knowledge, it is unclear whether vitamin D is a miracle medicine to prevent or slow down dementia, there is hope. Nevertheless, it is not easy to investigate whether a low vitamin D level often has an influence on the development of dementia years later.",unknown,Some studies suggest a possible connection between the vitamin D concentration in the blood and a deteriorating memory or dementia.  Whether vitamin D actually protects against memory deterioration or dementia remains open.
175,Does brain training boost intelligence?,"Those who train their memory only get better in these exercises, i.e. The training does not affect other mental tasks such as speech fluid or arithmetic. With a total of only 75 participants it is not very extensive, but strengthens the results of the overview work: even here, a 20-unit training did not improve the general intelligence [2]. Another review of 2013 casts doubt on how much cognitive training can be helpful for children and adolescents with various mental developmental disorders [3].",no,"There are many ways of brain training, but no evidence that it can improve intelligence. The most research in science is about a specific training of the ""working memory"", here the studies speak against a general improvement of intelligence."
176,Does petroleum help against cancer?,"One of the legends of Petroleum says that the workers in oil fields do not have cancer. The legend is not confirmed; large studies show that cancers in oil workers are as common as in other parts of the population [1] [2] [3], the risk of cancer is neither greater nor less for workers in the oil industry. [a] In Internet forums, kerosene is praised as a curative detox, but this can be thought of as ""detoxins"", we have already described here: https://www.medizin-transparent.at/mdzt4n5p4rnt/detox-of-mythos-vom-detoxins Studies in detail There are no studies on kerosene as a drug for cancer – for good reason, because a positive effect is far less likely than an additional health risk.",unknown,"This rather absurd assumption has not been tested in studies. Since petroleum is more likely to pose a health hazard, such studies are also not conducted."
177,Does lavender scent help with sleep disorders?,"Overall, the study situation is too thin to speak out for or against lavender aromatherapy. Need for clarification in many areas If it turns out that lavender aroma therapy is actually effective, many other questions need to be clarified: How much oil is needed to achieve an effect on sleep quality or duration? However, the better performance of the lavender therapy group could also have other reasons that have nothing to do with the treatment.",unknown,"Based on the state of studies, it is unclear whether inhaling lavender aroma can help with sleep disorders. Most of the currently available studies have gross methodological flaws. In addition, it is uncertain what undesirable side effects may result from (long-term) inhalation of lavender aroma."
178,Does the drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) enable high cure rates for chronic hepatitis C?,"Studies show that the new drug significantly increases treatment success: In patients who have not received treatment before, the chances of healing are now above 90 percent according to most studies [1] [2] [3] [a]. The active substance of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) is very successful in most of these patient groups, although not all groups have the same evidence [1] [2]. In any case, Sovaldi and other agents that directly attack the virus have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C and studies are currently underway to test the different combinations of drugs in different patient groups.",yes,"Yes, in combination with drugs that have been available for some time, cure rates of over 90 percent are possible with sofosbuvir. However, there are many different patient groups, and success rates are not the same for all."
179,Does alpha lipoic acid help prevent or treat Alzheimer's disease?,"Thus, we do not know whether alpha lipoic acid can mitigate the disease or even protect it from Alzheimer's disease [1]. Due to the few existing observational studies, they could not draw any conclusions or even make recommendations for the intake of alpha lipoic acid. So we have no indication whether the intake of alpha lipoic acid by healthy people (from food, as a dietary supplement) can prevent Alzheimer's from breaking out at all.",unknown,It remains to be seen whether alpha lipoic acid can help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. There is also a lack of conclusive studies on the question of the extent to which the substance can favorably influence the course of a disease that has already broken out.
180,Are Vemma products good for health?,"Quickly clarified There is no reason to believe that Vemma products have any health benefits; according to our research, they were only once the subject of a medical study – which, however, is completely unusable due to serious defects [1] Vemma, on the other hand, was often the subject of investigations, since the distribution system is very reminiscent of a pyramid game [b] [c]. However, the results are worthless for several reasons: there is no information on how the random assignment to the trial or placebo group happened, whether the blinding has kept, whether and how a blinding of the treating physicians has happened at all, the results contradict text and graphics and in the statistical analysis also serious errors have been made [1].",unknown,"We have found only one study that investigates health effects of Vemma. However, the study is so flawed that it does not allow us to draw any conclusions."
181,Do over-the-counter cough medicines relieve cough symptoms?,"Thus, it is impossible to know whether freely available cough medications actually help, or only facilitate the purse. The authors of the review analysed studies on a wide range of active substances: cough-saturating active substances: dextrometorphan, codeine (prescription) slime-solving agents: guaifenesin, bromhexin, ambroxol Various combinations of mucosa-swelling agents and antihistamines Overall, however, the studies analysed are of mostly doubtful quality and come to contradictory results. Thus, for none of these active substances authorised in Austria there is evidence of effective relief of cough symptoms. Even for the prescription codein, the study contribution in acute cough is unclear [1].",unknown,That over-the-counter cough medicines provide relief from acute cough is neither proven nor disproven - there are simply no studies of sufficient quality to answer this question.
182,Does a diet rich in vitamin K2 protect against diseases of the cardiovascular system?,"However, a vitamin-K-rich diet has no (favorable) influence on the occurrence of a stroke – also a cardiovascular disease, as reported in 2013. Vitamin K2-rich diet, however, has a positive effect on overall mortality and the risk of cancer. All in all, these data do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the general population or the optimal dose of the supposedly positive vitamin K2.",unknown,"While there are some studies that suggest a possible link between vitamin K2-rich diets and higher vascular health. However, the studies are not very conclusive."
183,Can shoe insoles relieve pain in people with high arches?,"[3] [6]...but little evidence of effectiveness There is good evidence of effectiveness only for a few foot defects, for example the hollow foot. Here insoles can distribute the pressure differently and thus reduce pain. [2] Also with Hallux valgus, a painful deformation of the large toe bale, deposits can provide at least in the short term for more well-being.",yes,"Shoe insoles are often prescribed for foot malpositions. However, there are hardly any good studies on the effectiveness of these remedies. So for the time being, it remains largely unclear what orthopedic shoe insoles can do for people with foot malpositions and whether they relieve pain in the long term."
184,Can shoe insoles relieve pain in people with foot deformities other than high arch?,[3] No clear statements can be made about the effectiveness of insoles in heel pain [3] [5] and in flat feet of children [4] and adults [1]. [3] The studies in detail Why is it not possible to make reliable statements about the (un)effectiveness of shoe inserts in foot malfunctions?,unknown,"Shoe insoles are often prescribed for foot malpositions. However, there are hardly any good studies on the effectiveness of these remedies. So for the time being, it remains largely unclear what orthopedic shoe insoles can do for people with foot malpositions and whether they relieve pain in the long term."
185,Can dowsers find harmful soil zones or water veins?,"Of three known studies in this direction, however, no supporting results are available. One of these three studies was carried out according to strict scientific guidelines – it finds no connection between harmful zones and an influence on skin resistance [3]. In the three studies found [6] [7] [8], dowsing rodents could not find artificially laid water veins more frequently than chance allows.The results of the studies are more similar to those of a statistical random experiment – according to the motto: Every blind chicken finds a grain. Furthermore, there were no large concordances of the randomly found water veins within or between the studies.",no,Small studies show that dowsing rods cannot detect water veins or hypothetical interference zones in the ground.
186,Does bioresonance therapy help with health complaints?,"In this regard, the Commission refers primarily to physical opinions which allegedly show that the basic principles of bioresonance are incorrect [1], but also mentions three clinical studies which have shown ineffectiveness. What to Know About Bioresonance There are no meaningful studies that certify efficacy of bioresonance, while two small clinical studies clearly speak against [7] [9]. The studies in detail The three studies already mentioned in the position name clearly show, on the one hand, that the method is not suitable for diagnosing allergies [8], on the other hand, they are only partly meaningful as a verification of efficacy – simply due to the low number of participants [7] [9]. Since 2006, some studies have been published, which allegedly speak for bioresonance, but most of them are scientifically worthless.",no,"Good studies on the question are hard to find. Due to the lack of proof of efficacy, the risk of misdiagnosis and the lack of plausibility, professional associations have been warning against bioresonance for some time."
187,Do irradiations with cold red light help with chronic gingivitis?,"Few studies, no effect The few studies published so far indicate, however, that cold red light cannot effectively relieve such inflammations [1] [2] [3]. The fact that cold red light is intended to reduce pain after dental surgery can also not prove previous research results [4]. In none of these, the participating researchers were able to find an additional benefit of cold red light irradiation for the usual periodontitis treatment. The summary analysis of existing studies does not indicate that cold red light can alleviate the consequences of dental surgery.",no,Previous studies indicate that chronic gingivitis and inflammation after dental surgery do not improve with irradiation with cold red light.
188,Does the Aspire system help you lose weight?,"Whether this system leads to the desired weight loss, however, can not be said for sure at the present time. However, it points to a strong effect: the study participants with the Aspire system lost an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, the comparison group only about 6 kilograms [1]. Patients with Aspire decreased an average of 21 kilograms in the first year, compared with about 6 kilograms in the comparative group.",yes,"Although there is only one small study on this, it shows a very large effect - which indicates that it is effective."
189,Can FLEXISEQ ointment relieve osteoarthritis pain?,"So the ointment FLEXISEQ would have to be compared to a placebo ointment – that hasn't happened yet; compared to a medication to be swallowed, a placebo to be swallowed, and an ointment with an active substance, but its effectiveness itself is not too clear. So it is not sure whether the ointment helps better than a suitable placebo. The study duration in the four individual studies described is a maximum of 12 weeks, so long-term effects have not yet been investigated.",unknown,Comparisons to date with other commonly used treatments are difficult to interpret but do not yield clear evidence of efficacy.
190,Can butterbur prevent migraine attacks?,"In summary, both studies show that it is twice as likely that the number of migraine attacks will halve after twelve weeks with the Pestwurz preparation compared to a dummy medication. The above overviews are of different quality, but all come to the same conclusions due to the two same studies: Pestwurz can reduce the number of migraine attacks for some patients.",yes,"Two well-done randomized-controlled trials show efficacy - the number of migraine attacks can probably be reduced with butterbur. Even if the effect is not huge, taking it may be worthwhile due to only minor side effects."
191,Does bisphenol A trigger allergies?,"Hormone-like substances on the pill For BPA, the evidence of an allergy-promoting effect is currently not very strong. The same study, which showed no correlation between the once measured BPA value in urine and existing allergies, found such association with the triclosan concentration in urine [2].",unknown,"Individual observational studies suggest an association between bisphenol A intake and the development of asthma, but not allergy, in early childhood. Asthma is often the consequence of allergy. However, the measurement of bisphenol A intake in these studies is too imprecise for a clear statement."
192,Can maggots accelerate the healing of chronic wounds compared to conventional treatment?,"Although the thorough cleansing of the wound is important for the healing process [2], there seems to be no indication that wounds heal faster after the maggot treatment [1]. Twelve months after the start of treatment, the number of subjects with healed chronic wounds in the maggot group was no greater than in patients with hydrogel associations.",no,"Maggot therapy may not heal chronic wounds any faster than conventional wound care. However, the maggots seem to be able to clean the wound of dead tissue more quickly - but also cause more pain."
193,Do electric toothbrushes protect oral health better than manual brushes?,"After a thorough analysis of all the results, they have come to a clear conclusion: Yes, electric toothbrushes are actually better for oral hygiene – but the difference is not large [1]. The electric oral cleaning thus removes a trace better than hand toothbrushes. If you brush your teeth electrically, you will also get a little less gingival inflammation than people who brush manually, according to the results of the analyzed studies. The advantage of electric toothbrushes compared to conventional toothbrushes is small.",yes,Electric toothbrushes probably combat plaque and bleeding gums slightly better than conventional manual toothbrushes. The type of electric brush does not seem to play a major role.
194,Do antidepressants from the group of serotonin reuptake inhibitors help with depression?,"Even if not all questions have been finally clarified around the SSRI group, the current study situation has revealed the following: SSRIs are effective. SSRIs are not ‘happy pills', the effects achieved are rather moderate. SSRI can be helpful in severe and probably also moderate depression. In fact, the study situation with SSRI, as measured by its wide spread, was rather modest over a long period of time.",yes,"Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to be helpful in more severe depression, although the exact mechanisms are not clear. Overall, very strong or rapid effects are not expected. For milder depression, efficacy is more debatable. Sometimes patients have to try several SSRI preparations until they feel an improvement in symptoms, and some sufferers are not helped by the drugs at all. Well-done studies should help clarify the situation in the future so that more targeted treatment is possible."
195,Is there a health risk from metal contaminants in lipsticks?,"Risk in individual cases unclear The cited study by the team led by study leader Liu [1] analysed 32 products on their metal content. The small amounts of lipstick thus do not lead to an increased risk of poisoning. If the use of lipsticks is therefore a health risk when used very frequently, only more detailed and extensive studies can show.",unknown,"Several chemical analyses find traces of metals in lipsticks, which can in principle be harmful in high concentrations. However, the analyses do not examine the quantities in which the metals are actually absorbed and whether they cause damage in the body. Overall, there is still too little research into whether there could be a risk for some of the metal impurities if they are used very frequently."
196,Can topiramate reduce the frequency of migraine attacks?,"The authors summarized the results of 17 studies and found that the number of headaches actually decreases – but only by one in 28 days. [1] The overview also shows positive effects on the overall quality of life, but only to a small extent and not quite without contradiction. Although all studies go in the same direction and indicate the effectiveness of topiramate, despite the review work of Cochrane Collaboration, the evidence is low, also because there are other criticisms: The authors have several conflicts of interest and it is possible that studies with poor results have not been published (publication bias). Little knowledge about chronic migraine In the expert recommendation on therapy and care for chronic migraine, two small studies are mentioned, according to which topiramate can also prevent in chronic migraine attacks [2].",yes,"Possibly yes. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration attests that topiramate slightly reduces the frequency of migraine attacks in adults, and in some patients the attacks even decrease significantly. Still, there are unanswered questions and the side effects should not be underestimated."
197,Does particulate matter pollution increase the risk of heart attack - even if the EU limits are complied with?,"The study of over 367,000 adults from 13 European countries indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter generally increases the risk of mortality – meaning life-saving [1]. The authors reported that long-term exposure to particulate matter at the place of residence makes the occurrence of heart attack and unstable angina pectoris ('heart', a sign of an imminent heart attack) more likely. An English cohort study from 2013 could not deduce a link between heart attack risk and fine dust air pollution, but fine dust exposure increased the risks of other heart diseases. The short-term inhalation of larger amounts of fine dust may also make a heart attack more likely.",yes,"Recent studies from Europe indicate that everyday exposure to particulate matter may increase the risk of acute heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). General mortality may also be increased already by 'allowed' long-term exposure within the current EU limits."
198,Are endocrine disruptors in cosmetics a health risk?,"Thus, the risk for parabens is not demonstrated by clinical studies, especially not by cosmetics. Many chemicals are not researched at all, the interaction with certain diseases is unknown and it is also not sufficiently clear when and how endocrine disruptors intervene in the physical development of adolescents [b]. Humans are therefore exposed to many such influences, which makes risk assessment very difficult.",unknown,"Although many cosmetics do indeed contain substances that can influence the hormone system, a health risk has not been proven. Ecological consequences, on the other hand, have already been demonstrated."
199,"Can a dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids, lipids, vitamins, and nutrients (""Souvenaid"") noticeably slow or halt the decline of mental performance in Alzheimer's disease?","A comparison of the test values of the product and placebo groups with the end of the study shows no noticeable difference in the memory performance of the participants. Two randomised-controlled studies for six to twelve months [4] and a third randomised-controlled study for 18 months [5] show that omega-3 fat-containing fish oil capsules cannot improve mental capacity in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Whether one can prevent or delay the outbreak of Alzheimer's disease, if one regularly eats fish oil capsules, is not sufficiently investigated [6]. Those who swallow preparations containing vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid should not be able to prevent mild to mild Alzheimer's disease from progressing [6].",no,Three randomized-controlled trials show that such a dietary supplement (Souvenaid®) is unlikely to markedly slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Taking omega-3 fatty acid or vitamin B supplements alone also does not appear to have such an effect.
200,Do vitamin E supplements increase the likelihood of early death?,The result: more deaths occur in the vitamin E group than in the comparison group without vitamin supplements. This meta-analysis also results in a slightly increased number of deaths due to vitamin E preparations. This calculates an increased risk of premature death in vitamin E intake by three percent [2].,yes,"Studies on this topic are very inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that vitamin E increases the risk of death. A meta-analysis warns against high-dose vitamin preparations."
201,Does meditation help against stress?,"Stress reduction in healthy people is shown, but not whether it is actually due to treatment. A new review [3] summarizes 47 studies and brings better data – even if things remain complicated: Although some forms of meditation work against stress, only in comparison to control groups that receive no other targeted treatment. The authors of an overview of mindfulness-based stress reduction [4] report in their summary that this form of therapy improves mental health, both in healthy people and in some patients with mental illnesses. According to the systematic review work of 2014, not all types of meditation are equally effective: for mindfulness-based meditation, an effectiveness can be demonstrated, but not for transcendental meditation, in which the concentration of attention is sought to dissolve [3].",yes,"Various forms of meditation seem to be able to alleviate stress both in healthy individuals and in people with mental illness. Studies on this are numerous, but the quality of the studies is consistently unsatisfactory."
202,Are there methods that effectively help against hormonal hair loss?,"The efficacy of the active substance minoxidil is very well secured. Regular use of a 2 or 3% minoxidil solution on the scalp may lead to cosmetically significant improvements in approximately three out of ten men affected [6]. Also in women with hormonal hair loss shows the treatment with Minoxidil effect. Also scientifically well documented is the effect of finasteride [1] [2] [4] [5] [6]. There is evidence that the active substance can improve hormonal hair loss, as it intervenes in the hormone balance similar to finasteride.",yes,"Besides own hair transplantation, the active substances finasteride or minoxidil (as a solution) can help, but both agents have side effects. The effectiveness of other means is hardly or not secured."
203,Does eye training help prevent myopia?,"A systematic review did not find a controlled study in 2005 that could show an effect of eye training on shortsightedness – nor any that would suggest a preventive effect of eye training [1]. For other forms of falseness, there are also small and methodologically weak studies that find no difference between eye training and a control group [1]. But in most cases there is no evidence of the effect of visual training [1] [3].",no,"According to the current state of studies, an effectiveness of eye training can only be expected for very few diseases; an effect as prevention or therapy against myopia cannot be assumed at present."
204,Does Cryolipolysis cause noticeable body fat reduction?,"Whether the method can effectively reduce body fat cannot be said based on its results. Whether the reason for the alleged figure improvements after three to six or twelve months was actually the cold treatment, however, can not be determined by previous-after-comparisons without an untreated control group anyway. Even if the authors of previously published studies conjure the effectiveness of cryolipolysis – this cannot be objectively assessed on the basis of their results.",unknown,"The effectiveness of cryolipolysis cannot be assessed objectively, as there are no scientific efficacy studies on it."
205,Is acupuncture for chronic pain more effective than placebo acupuncture treatment?,"Acupuncture slightly surpasses dummy treatment A recent study is now to show that the pain-relieving effect of acupuncture exceeds that of a mere placebo effect, several media write. The very thorough analysis of all these clinical studies showed that acupuncture in chronic pain was not only better than no treatment, but also slightly better than a sham acupuncture. Also in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder of the musculature, acupuncture probably has a slight, but hardly noticeably better effect than sham acupuncture [9]. Even if the mechanism of action of acupuncture is unknown and the placebo effect is partly responsible for its analgesic effect, it appears to be an interesting alternative or additional therapy for patients with chronic pain.",yes,"Acupuncture is slightly superior to sham acupuncture treatment for some types of pain. However, pain patients are unlikely to notice this difference."
206,Can Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy reduce the burden of tinnitus?,"Accordingly, the authors of a systematic review of Cochrane Collaboration [ 1 ] found strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy can lead to a noticeable improvement in the quality of life despite persistent tinnitus. In addition, the therapy can lead to a low relief of depressive moods, which suffer from numerous tinnitus patients. The self-help training developed at Linköping University in Sweden is a version of an already proven cognitive behavioral therapy program for tinnitus patients adapted to the Internet. But also a newly developed Internet program to increase tinnitus acceptance with the help of mindfulness-based strategies proved equally effective. Summary It seems likely that cognitive therapies for tinnitus management not only bring improvement in traditional group sessions, but also in the form of Internet-based self-help training programs.",yes,"Cognitive behavioral therapy can noticeably improve the quality of life and depressiveness of tinnitus sufferers. Internet-based self-help training based on cognitive behavioral therapy could be similarly helpful, but is often discontinued by sufferers."
207,Do probiotic foods have an antidepressant effect or a positive effect on the mind?,The study referred to in oe24.at [1] cannot answer the question whether probiotic foods improve the mood. The scientists do not indicate whether the probiotically treated subjects were already less depressed and anxious before the start of the experiment than those who did not receive a probiotic product.,unknown,"Whether probiotics can help with depression or have a positive effect on the mood has never been investigated in clinical trials. In people with constipation, they could possibly improve mood."
208,Does treatment with radioactive agents help with pain in chronic inflammatory joint disease?,"If the correct amount of a suitable radioactive substance is injected directly into the joint, the radiation causes the swollen and inflamed joint mucosa to die – after healing, a healthy skin can grow back, the inflammation is gone [1]. According to a 2009 overview study, success rates in small joints vary from 54 to 100 percent pain reduction 12 months after treatment, from 29 to 94 percent pain reduction in large joints [1]. A somewhat recent randomized-controlled study compared two drugs for radiosynoviorthesis and cortisone: after 48 weeks, the frequently used yttrium performed better than cortisone and the comparator, but only in a single point – namely on a particular pain scale.",yes,"Depending on the cause of the pain, radiosynoviorthesis can lead to considerable pain reduction, as confirmed by a 2009 review. However, it is not proven whether the treatment is more effective than cortisone treatment."
209,Does frequent porn use reduce gray matter volume in the brain?,"[1] Cause and effect The study shows a correlation between frequent consumption of porn and the size of a brain region, but cannot provide any information as to whether the size of the gray brain mass changes due to consumption of porn. No damage detectable In 2011, three Californian researchers pointed out that there was no evidence of brain damage due to porn consumption. All studies that went in this direction have the same problem as the current study: It is not clear what is the cause and what is the effect – there is no study that actually investigates the long-term effects of porn consumption on the brain.",unknown,The study is not powered to examine the long-term effects of pornography on the brain and other studies on this were not found.
210,Can the active ingredient acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) protect against cancer?,"Minor reduction in cancer risk According to a recent systematic review [ 1 ], daily intake of ASA actually results in a minor reduction in cancer risk. Among 1000 subjects who took ASA, 16 people died of cancer on average, while those who received only an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) were19. In a cohort study over ten years, the intake of ASA only led to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer every other day, but also to increased gastrointestinal bleeding [5].",yes,"Taking ASA daily for several years seems to be able to reduce the risk of dying from cancer somewhat. However, it increases the risk of severe internal bleeding and stomach problems."
211,Is tick-borne tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) much milder in children than in adults?,"Although only 20 children participated in this study, there is a certain trend: young patients generally had less severe symptoms and recovered faster than adults. Except for one case of complete vaccination and two cases of incomplete vaccination, the affected children were unvaccinated [11] and more frequently developed meningitis, while adults were more likely to fight with the more dangerous inflammation of the brain and cerebral membranes (meningo-encephalitis).",yes,"Current studies suggest that TBE is probably associated with milder symptoms in children than in adults. Permanent damage is also less frequent in younger patients. However, TBE can also have severe health consequences in children in individual cases."
212,"Does treatment with cyanoacrylate (for example, Sapheon Venaseal™) help against varicose veins as well or better than other methods?","There are other scientific studies to close varicose veins with cyanoacrylate, but these do not meet current scientific requirements. However, the efficacy cannot be assessed precisely, since the study authors had not compared their method to another treatment or sham treatment. How good the method is compared to other methods has not been adequately studied [7].",unknown,"To date, there are no results from clinical studies on this method. The efficacy in comparison with other treatments is therefore unclear."
213,"Did oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) or other neuraminidase inhibitors help reduce deaths from the H1N1 influenza virus (""swine flu"" virus)?",It is striking that the raw data do not show a significant difference in the death rate between neuraminidase inhibitors and untreated patients. Tamiflu alone did not investigate whether the Tamiflu active substance oseltamivir saved lives during the H1N1 pandemic was not investigated separately in the study funded by the Tamiflu manufacturer.,unknown,"Previously published analyses of data from the H1N1 influenza (""swine flu"") pandemic period are of insufficient quality to answer this question."
214,Is aluminum intake responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease?,"Cause unknown As far as the cause of pathological memory loss is concerned, research is still relatively in the dark. However, due to the implementation of the study, it cannot be concluded that small traces of aluminium are actually the triggering cause of Alzheimer's disease.",unknown,"Scientific studies cannot prove with certainty a connection between the metal aluminum and the disease Alzheimer, but they cannot exclude it either."
215,Can regular exercise prevent or relieve migraine symptoms?,"In a systematic overview from 2008 [ 2 ] of 7 studies with very low participation numbers, the authors conclude that sporting activity can probably lead to a slight reduction in the pain intensity of further migraine attacks. A randomized-controlled study [ 3 ] in 30 migraine patients found at least a small reduction in the pain intensity of future migraine seizures for a combination program of aerobic training followed by muscle relaxation. In another, less rigorous study [ 4 ] in 16 patients, compared to migraine patients who did not participate in any sports program, there was also a small reduction in pain intensity. In a recent study from 2009 [ 5 ], the scientists found a similar improvement in the frequency of monthly migraine attacks. Too little comprehensive investigations for clear effect In summary, a certain effectiveness of regularly operated endurance sports such as jogging or cycling for prevention of migraine attacks seems likely.",yes,"In some, but not all, studies, regular exercise seems to at least somewhat reduce the pain intensity of future migraine attacks. Whether the frequency of migraine attacks can also be reduced cannot be assessed with certainty. for this, larger, better validated studies would have to be conducted."
216,Does less than 7h of sleep daily increase mental performance?,"Already six hours of sleep reduce brain performance The results of a small randomized-controlled study [1] clearly contradict the claim of performance-enhancing sleep loss. After only a few nights it became apparent: the shorter the participants could sleep at night, the worse they did in the tests compared to the group with eight hours of sleep. The performance of the sleep deficit group was significantly worse after five days compared to the control group, although the impact is limited by the small size of the control group. This shows that lack of sleep actually seemed to be the cause of the worse mental performance. Overall, if you sleep only six or less hours per night, you will hardly be wiser, but it seems to impair your mental performance.",no,Two small randomized-controlled studies indicate that mental performance decreases with the number of sleepless hours per night and the number of nights with insufficient sleep. No single scientific study provides evidence of an increase in mental performance due to shorter sleep duration.
217,Does regular intake of extra virgin olive oil protect against coronary heart disease such as heart attack?,"Probably related to reduced risk of heart attack Many research groups have already studied the question of whether olive oil can actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and other heart diseases over the last two decades. When eating more than 30 grams of olive oil per day, the risk of heart disease was only about half as high as in people who consumed less than 15 grams per day or no olive oil at all. The olive oil-rich diet resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of heart attack and death for almost five years by just under a third compared to a conventional diet. Study participants with high olive oil consumption were significantly less likely to be found in the group of heart attack patients, the scientists therefore concluded that the oil had a significant protective effect. The results of the two most reliable and largest cohort studies [ 2, 3 ] indicate a likely protective effect of increased consumption of cold-pressed olive oil over several years.",yes,"Regular consumption of cold-pressed olive oil may possibly prevent coronary heart disease. However, direct evidence is still pending."
218,Do frequent ejaculations have a protective effect against prostate cancer?,"Result: Men with frequent ejaculations between 20 and 30 years of age have a one-third reduced prostate cancer risk compared to those with rare ejaculations [1]. Taking the result seriously, it doesn't show that much self-satisfaction protects, but rather that men with very few ejaculations could have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer. Here it turns out that frequent ejaculations from the age of four years onwards or over the entire life span may reduce the risk of prostate cancer [3]. In sum, the study provides evidence that with increasing ejaculation frequency, the risk of prostate cancer could actually decrease.",yes,"A cohort study suggests that more frequent ejaculations starting at age 40, or over a lifetime, could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer. This is not exclusive to ejaculations from masturbation, but from any sexual activity."
219,Does condom use cause depression in women?,"Like any contraceptive method, the condom has disadvantages that it causes depression in women, but is nowhere documented. Maybe less fun We have not found a study that specifically investigated whether the use of condoms in sex can lead to depression in women. If condoms were to promote depression, it would be unlikely that depression would decrease if used more frequently. They have found no correlations between condom use and depression [4]. Risk factors for depression In any case, condoms cannot be found in the list of recognised risk factors.",unknown,A study examining exactly this question was not found. Some scientific works with a broad question rather lead to the conclusion that there is no connection between depression and condom use.
220,Do today's children have a shorter life expectancy than their parents?,"Overweight leads to a higher rate of premature deaths – which reduces life expectancy on average by 3 to 9 months. So it would be a reversal of the trend: for the first time in a long time, children would have a life expectancy less than their parents. There are some reasons to assume that it will be worse than the 3 to 9 months less: Obesity is becoming more common and occurs in increasingly younger children [1]. If this trend continues, there may be a reduction in life expectancy of three to five years.",yes,"Obesity and physical inactivity are increasing risk factors worldwide that can shorten life. In 2005, a study from the USA concluded that life expectancy could be reduced by 3 to 9 months when these risks were included."
221,Do rising temperatures and CO2 levels increase the risk of pollen allergy?,"It is unclear whether the increase in CO2 has already caused a noticeable increase in the amount of pollen released. Influence on allergy risk unclear However, whether the increasing pollen exposure also increases the risk of developing pollen allergy for non-allergic agents is unclear. Whether higher levels of pollen increase the probability of hay fever is so far unclear [5]. There is nothing to read about pollen becoming more aggressive in so far published studies.",unknown,"Rising temperatures and increased CO2 concentrations cause plants to produce larger amounts of pollen over a longer period of time. However, it is unclear whether larger amounts of pollen and a longer pollen season increase the likelihood of developing pollen allergy."
222,Does training on vibration platforms cause a noticeable buildup of muscle strength?,"Therefore, training on vibration platforms could actually strengthen the muscle strength of the leg muscles. However, compared to conventional strengthening training, the results do not indicate superiority of vibration platforms. According to the results of this study, it could be concluded at most that training on a vibration platform in combination with a diet can lead to weight loss, which could also be achieved by a conventional fitness program or a mere diet without exercise program.",yes,"Vibration training may be helpful for building muscle strength in the legs, but it is not better than conventional training for this purpose. Whether the method is also suitable for weight reduction has not been sufficiently studied."
223,Does glucosamine prolong life?,"This is exactly what happens once again in the article on glucosamine as a life prolonger: The study was conducted on nematodes (fade worms) and mice and in which glucosamine led to an extended life span [1]. The conclusion of the researchers: If glucosamine has the same effect in two different species and these processes are also conceivable in humans, then glucosamine is highly likely to prolong life expectancy in humans. Yes, with many limitations There is a cohort study on humans on this question: In 2010, a first evaluation looked at the influence of 20 vitamins or dietary supplements on life expectancy [3]; of these 20 only glucosamine and chondroitin showed a possible relationship with life expectancy. The researchers speculate that glucosamine prolongs life expectancy just as was found in aspirin [2]. Until then, the life-prolonging effect of glucosamine remains optimistic speculation with little evidence.",yes,"Although research here is still in its infancy and there is only one cohort study in humans besides basic studies, this shows possible effects. Further studies with better methods and other groups of participants are necessary."
224,Does Kinesio tape help in the treatment of joint and muscle injuries?,"Therefore, it cannot be said whether the tape could contribute to the improvement of the pain after a long period of time. Overall, the efficacy of Kinesio tape in musculoskeletal pain and injuries is at best unclear. Since no studies have been carried out for more than 6 days, however, nothing can be said about a possible longer-term effect of the tape.",unknown,There is no evidence that kinesio tape can reduce pain within a few days. It is unclear whether taping can help improve movement restrictions caused by an injury.
225,Do injections with Botulinum Toxin A (Botox®) help with urinary incontinence?,"According to the standard, Botulinum Toxin A (known as Botox®) has been approved in Ireland and possibly other European countries for the treatment of incontinence caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries. Efficacy of Botulinum Toxin A A summary of the results of 19 randomised-controlled studies, each with a relatively small number of participants, shows good efficacy [1]. Therefore, a single series of injections with Botulinum Toxin A in the bladder's detrusor muscle can significantly reduce the frequency of urinary loss in patients with incontinence.",yes,"Several small randomized-controlled trials show that injections of botulinum toxin A into the detrusor muscle surrounding the urinary bladder can reduce, but not completely prevent, the incidence of involuntary urinary leakage."
226,Can apigenin reduce cancer risk or prevent cancer progression?,"On the other hand, a laboratory study [5] found that apigenin might inhibit the effect of chemotherapy treatments. However, when treated with apigenin, the cancer cells became resistant to this drug and did not die. Apigenine without influence on cancer risk What applies in small cases could also apply in large cases. This showed that those participants who had eaten the most apigenine with food were not less likely to have cancer than other women in the study. Unefficacious and possibly risky Apart from laboratory findings, previous observational studies show that the potential protective effect of apigenin is not able to significantly reduce the risk of cancer in normal diets [8].",no,"Studies suggest that even high levels of apigenin in food do not protect against cancer. In individual cases, it is suspected that apigenin in high amounts could weaken the effect of chemotherapy or even accelerate cancer growth."
227,Do generic drugs work as well as original drugs?,"Results & Interpretation In a review of 7 individual studies [1] published in 2010, three active substances against epilepsy were compared with generic drugs, with no evidence of an increased probability of seizures. For none of the active substances studied, there was evidence of a lower efficacy of the generic medicinal product. Based on the studies published so far, there is no evidence of inferiority of generic medicinal products compared to original medicinal products.",yes,"Yes, the summarized results of clinical studies do not provide any evidence for a poorer efficacy of generics compared to originator drugs. However, comparative studies exist only for some agents against cardiovascular diseases and epilepsy."
228,Are animal-assisted therapies effective for mental illness?,"The authors conclude from the data that animal assisted therapies may be effective in some diseases, including mental disorders and behavioural disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and addiction. There is still no reliable data on the efficacy of animal-based therapy, for example in patients with cancer and advanced fatal diseases, in terms of state of health and quality of life.",yes,"Studies on the effects of animal-assisted therapies are only partially conclusive. It seems plausible that animal-assisted therapies can be supportive for some mental illnesses; however, very large or rapid effects are unlikely."
229,Can lack of sleep cause obesity?,"So, most likely, lack of sleep is just one of many different factors that can affect weight gain. Cause unclear The mere fact that people with a lack of sleep are more likely to be overweight or gain more weight than those who sleep, however, does not necessarily mean that the lack of sleep is the real cause of obesity. People who sleep too little usually have an unhealthy lifestyle in general, so other factors can also play a role in increasing weight gain. Whether lack of sleep actually makes you fat can't be said from previous study results – even if there is evidence that people who sleep little may become overweight rather than people with normal sleep.",unknown,People who regularly get too little sleep may be more likely to be overweight than those who get enough sleep. But whether lack of sleep itself causes obesity is unclear.
230,Is breaking an energy-saving lamp harmful to health?,"[3] If an energy-saving lamp breaks, the mercury contained therein escapes, among other things, in the form of mercury vapour. However, these experiments did not directly investigate whether this could lead to signs of poisoning in humans. Even if the safety limit has been exceeded in some cases, mercury vapour concentrations in the ambient air did not reach levels for which a health hazard is considered probable in any study.",unknown,"If an energy-saving lamp breaks, mercury vapor is released in quantities that can exceed the limits considered safe. Whether this can cause damage to health has not been directly investigated. However, after removal of the broken glass and good ventilation of the room, the value quickly falls back below the limit value."
231,Does copper intake increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease?,Because there are no studies that associate an increased uptake of copper directly with an increased Alzheimer's risk [6].,unknown,Some studies claim to have found links between high copper levels and Alzheimer's disease. Whether copper intake actually has an impact on Alzheimer's risk is not clear.
232,Do air ions cause an improvement of allergies?,Hardly any studies on anti-allergic effects No clinical studies have been performed to date on the alleged anti-allergic effects of air ions.,unknown,"Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
233,Do air ions cause an improvement of asthma??,"Compared to asthma patients who were exposed to dummy treatment, actual therapy with air ionization devices did not show any improvement in asthma symptoms or lung function.",no,"Whether ionized air can reduce allergic symptoms is unclear, as no studies exist on this question. Air ionization devices do not appear to be effective against asthma in general."
234,Do smoking bans lead to fewer preterm births?,"Smoking bans mean that mothers smoke less in pregnancy and that unborn women are exposed to less passive smoke. It is a methodically very good work, but there are some limitations to the statements: the results of the individual studies vary greatly, whether the real effect is really 10% each, will only be able to clarify future studies.",yes,"A large review shows a 10% reduced risk of preterm birth. Due to some limitations, the evidence is nevertheless low, further studies from different countries will probably soon bring clarity."
235,Do special garments with the active ingredient Liporeductyl help against cellulite?,"An effect could not be found for any active substance [1]. Or, to put it more carefully, for none of the innumerable forms of treatment have well-derived scientific evidence that speaks for effectiveness.",unknown,"There are only small studies that neither stand up to methodological criteria nor have been scientifically published. Sustained efficacy has not been proven, which, according to the current status, applies to all common remedies against cellulite."
236,Does alcohol in moderate amounts prolong life?,"Alcohol: Beyond good and evil As described in our article on red wine, moderate alcohol consumption probably has a positive effect on cardiovascular health [2]; moderate means an alcoholic drink per day – a small beer or an eighth of wine.",yes,"In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
237,Does caffeine make us die sooner???,"However, this does not yet clarify whether caffeine shortens or prolongs life. This does not mean that it is caffeine that reduces the risk of mortality; it only shows that people who drink a lot of coffee differ in their risk from people who drink little coffee. Why this is so and what role caffeine itself plays is not clarified – even if it could be shown by which mechanisms caffeine may have its positive effect [c].",unknown,"In moderate amounts, alcohol could reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely. In higher doses, however, it clearly increases this risk. This is unclear for caffeine."
238,Does light freezing help with weight loss?,"Much speculation, little knowledge A scientific work taken up by many media does not help with this question [1]. Nevertheless, weight loss was not significantly higher than after the same exercise program at more pleasant temperatures.",unknown,"Some laboratory studies show that the body reacts to colder temperatures with higher energy consumption and burns more fat. Nevertheless, it is completely unclear whether this supports weight loss; that is, whether the process is strong enough and whether other mechanisms do not work against it. Weight loss through freezing has not been investigated in clinical studies."
239,Does acupuncture help against hay fever?,"As with other acupuncture studies, it is therefore questionable whether the improvement of hay fever symptoms was due to the needle stitches themselves. In order to distinguish between the placebo effect and the specific effect of acupuncture in the future, further studies with better study designs are necessary.",unknown,We have not found any meaningful studies that can provide evidence of improvement in hay fever.
240,Do earrings cause discomfort by destroying acupuncture points or meridians?,"However, we could not find any studies that would have investigated earrings and their effects on meridians or acupuncture points.",unknown,"Earrings very often lead to complications, fortunately most of them are harmless. However, whether earrings can also destroy meridians or similar representation points of body regions in the auricle and thus lead to health complaints has not been investigated in studies."
241,"Does the ""Rolfing"" treatment cause an improvement of body malpositions as well as certain pains?","Therefore, it cannot be automatically deduced from these results that the cause of the pain reduction lies in the Rolfing treatments. Overall, the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of Rolfing technology for the treatment of pain or correction of body malpositions is insufficient.",unknown,"The few studies on ""Rolfing"" are too inconclusive to answer the question."
242,Does marijuana use reduce the risk of developing diabetes?,"Marijuana users have rare diabetes A cross-sectional study in 2012 of 10,896 US-Americans [2] revealed that marijuana consumers were less likely to suffer from diabetes. However, they cannot show with certainty that the use of marijuana is actually responsible for the reduced risk of diabetes. Marijuana may reduce risk factors The authors of a smaller cross-sectional study in 4657 subjects [3] found a connection between smoking marijuana and the reduced occurrence of insulin resistance, a precursor of diabetes. People who regularly consumed marijuana had a 12 percent lower chance of developing insulin resistance.",yes,Two cross-sectional studies provide evidence for a diabetes-preventive effect of active ingredients from the cannabis plant. That the consumption of marijuana actually reduces the risk of diabetes has yet to be confirmed by extensive studies.
243,Do fish oil capsules promote prostate cancer?,"[4] [5] High dose of fish oil could increase prostate cancer risk The article in the courier is based on a recently published case-control study [1]. The US study authors concluded that high blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids DHA, EPA and DPA are associated with a higher probability of prostate cancer. Study participants with particularly large amounts of this omega-3 fat in the blood had an increased risk of prostate cancer by 43 percent compared to men with low intake of fish oil. A systematic review [2] of previous studies seems to support these findings: As a result, high concentrations of the two omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in the blood could increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer by 39 percent (i.e. The researchers can show a connection between the consumption of high doses of fish oils and the occurrence of prostate cancer.",yes,"In general, there seems to be a negative effect of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil capsules: DHA and EPA in high doses could increase the risk of prostate cancer. However, the results should be viewed with caution. Other, still unknown factors could also play an important role."
244,Does virgin conception exist?,"Until now, fertilization without sexual contact – biologists refer to it as parthenogenesis – is only known from a few animal species. In humans, the phenomenon is hardly researched, the present study is the only scientific study on this subject so far.",unknown,"To date, only one study has been conducted on this issue. The scientific evidence based on this study does not allow a clear answer."
245,Are movement exercises useful for back pain?,"Targeted exercise to strengthen torso muscles should both relieve and prevent back pain. As a systematic overview [1] shows, strengthening exercises can clearly prevent the recurrence of pain. One of the results: Chronic cross pain (duration over twelve weeks) improves at least something when the sufferers perform regular exercise.",yes,"Exercise reduces the risk of getting back pain again and can relieve chronic back pain somewhat. However, quick relief from acute pain is not to be expected."
246,Does taking the birth control pill adversely affect mate choice? (Reader inquiry),"Since ovulation does not occur by taking the pill and there are hormonal fluctuations with it, some researchers suspect that this also has an effect on the attractiveness of women taking the pill. Claims that taking the pill leads to the wrong choice of partner or the withdrawal of the pill leads to the breakup of a relationship are exaggerated speculation and scientifically unproven.",unknown,"Even though individual studies find a slight correlation between taking the pill and choosing a partner, there is no evidence that it negatively affects partner choice."
247,Does UV light reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"The result: 20 minutes under artificial UVA light may reduce blood pressure slightly in the short term. Whether regular UVA irradiation can also reduce blood pressure in the long term cannot be predicted from this, longer-term studies would be necessary. Cardiovascular diseases vs. cancer Overall, the evidence for reducing the heart risk from sunbathing is still insufficient – only more extensive and more precise studies can give an answer.",unknown,"It is theoretically conceivable that UVB light could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, studies published so far cannot sufficiently confirm this assumption."
248,"Is the Gynefix® contraceptive necklace as effective for contraception as the birth control pill or the ""IUD""?","Result According to a systematic review by Cochrane Collaboration (O-Brien & Marfleet, 2008), the prevention effectiveness of the 6-member Gynefix® smelting chain is comparable to that of the copper-holding intrauterine pessar (Spirale) TCu380 or TCu380A (There are insufficient meaningful data available for the assessment of the smaller 4-member fetter). In both cases – with an old and a new insertion device for the contraceptive chain – there is no significant difference between the spiral group and the Gynefix® group. There is therefore no significant difference between copper spiral and contraceptive chains in both studies.",yes,"The 6-link copper-containing contraceptive necklace Gynefix® is comparable in contraceptive effectiveness to other copper-containing intrauterine devices (""IUDs""). A comparison with the contraceptive effectiveness of the contraceptive pill is not satisfactorily possible based on our research."
249,Can coenzyme Q10 lead to a rejuvenation of the skin's appearance?,"No evidence of skin rejuvenation In a small study in 60 women [ 1 ], researchers investigated the effect of taking coenzyme Q10 – holding food supplement capsules for 12 weeks on the skin.",unknown,"Since there are no studies on this subject conducted according to common scientific standards, this question cannot be answered."
250,Is there an increased risk of long-term effects on the unborn child with chemotherapy starting in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy?,"Chemotherapy in pregnancy with possible effects Chemotherapy in pregnancy is in principle a risk to the unborn because of the toxic properties of cytostatic agents. However, compared to healthy peers, more children of chemotherapy-treated mothers showed mild abnormalities of heartbeat. A study [ 2 ], in which the children were accompanied for an average of over three years, found that the newborns who were exposed to chemotherapy from the second trimester of pregnancy were on average 200 grams lighter than children of cancer-sick mothers without chemotherapy treatment. Conclusion The likelihood of a high accumulation of severe malformations or severe long-term effects for children who were exposed to chemotherapy from the second trimester of pregnancy appears to be low.",yes,"Studies published to date do not suggest a greatly increased risk of adverse effects on the child, but such a risk cannot be ruled out."
251,Can regular screening significantly reduce the risk of dying from prostate cancer?,"Regular PSA tests can hardly reduce the likelihood of dying early, but have a high risk of severe side effect. In the Swedish arm of a randomized-controlled study from 2011 [3], the damage caused by the overtherapy is clearly shown in figures: 37 men whose tumor was discovered by PSA screening must on average be removed from the prostate to save one's life.",no,"The regular PSA screening test can hardly reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer. In fact, it often leads to overdiagnosis with serious consequences such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction."
252,Does removal and examination of the first lymph nodes after the prostate is affected by cancer (sentinel lymph nodes or sentinel lymph nodes) improve the chances of cure? (Reader Inquiry),"In 2010, the claim that removal and examination of the guardian lymph nodes can reduce the risk of further metastases in patients with prostate cancer. Another series of cases involving a little over 1000 patients [ 2 ] showed that in about two thirds of prostate cancer cases nodes were found infected with the guardian lymph node examination, which would have been disregarded at a conventional removal of most surrounding lymph nodes.",unknown,"Removal and examination of sentinel lymph nodes helps assess the progression of prostate cancer. However, whether it improves the chances of cure cannot be said due to the low level of scientific evidence."
253,Can a treatment with singing bowls relieve pain?,"The participants felt much more relaxed, calmer and better tuned both after the treatment and after the sham treatment. An effect is therefore attributable solely to the placebo effect.",no,Singing bowl therapy does not appear to be effective for relieving pain.
254,"Is the HIV saliva self-test, which is about to be approved in the U.S., as reliable as a laboratory test or a rapid test at the doctor's office?","More inaccurate than the doctor The saliva test is relatively reliable, but is less accurate than a rapid test performed with blood. In any case, manufacturers of HIV rapid tests recommend a test result evaluation by laboratory tests.",yes,"The aforementioned HIV self-test of saliva samples is significantly less accurate than a standard laboratory blood test. Relatively likely, it is also more inaccurate when self-performed than a rapid saliva or blood test performed by a physician."
255,Does religion promote mental health?,"Nevertheless, the question is far from clear, for which there are a number of reasons: Hardly any significance religion, religiosity and spirituality can be distinguished from each other and also very difficult to measure. It is almost impossible to bring together the results of the individual studies and, subsequently, the survey work. The term ""religion"" is simply too comprehensive to be judged as a single factor.",unknown,"The studies do not allow any conclusion to be drawn for several reasons: the results are contradictory, only a few studies are by independent authors, and religion is not a concept that is measured uniformly; neither effects nor side effects can be clearly attributed to the factor ""religion"" because there is no such thing as a uniform factor ""religion."""
256,Do braces treatments have preventive medical benefits in addition to aesthetic ones?,"At present, it is not yet possible to assess all the health consequences of dental regulation, neither the positive nor the negative. The result was somewhat devastating for orthodontics: no studies were found to investigate long-term efficacy, nor any that dealt with general oral health: ""Whether remedying tooth defects is an effective prerequisite for maintaining natural toothing cannot be answered,"" says the summary. It is not clear when there is a need for regulation at all (""research is almost completely lacking""), nor how the risk of caries or the breakdown of the tooth root are affected. Adverse reactions and long-term consequences are therefore far too little researched. There is no indication of a risk from regulation, nor that dental regulation can prevent or treat diseases of the jaw joints [7] [8].",unknown,"The long-term effects of tooth straightening are still very poorly researched. Apart from obvious effects in extreme malocclusions, there is no good evidence for either medical benefit or high risk."
257,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of vaccinating infants simultaneously with the usual six-dose vaccine (against diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae B) and a pneumococcal vaccine? (Reader inquiry)","According to a systematic review [ 1 ], the risk of adverse reactions after a combination of six-fold vaccination plus pneumococcal vaccination increases slightly. In summary, the co-administration of pneumococcal and previous six-fold vaccination shows no reduced protection against the pathogens, while the risk of adverse reactions is slightly increased.",yes,"Simultaneous vaccination with pneumococcal and six-way vaccine results in essentially equivalent protection against the 6 pathogens compared with six-way vaccination alone. The somewhat increased risk of fever after vaccination is offset by additional, nearly complete protection against pneumococcal infection and infection."
258,Does the use of laptops with active WLAN (wireless internet access) affect sperm quality in men?,"However, no such or similar study has been carried out so far – therefore, there is currently no indication for a sperm-damaging effect of WLAN radiation. Conclusion Even though the Argentinean researchers were aware of the heat development by laptops in their WLAN examination and kept the temperature of sperm samples in their glass bowls constantly low – there is no direct evidence of the acute threat to male fertility from the use of laptops – with or without WLAN.",unknown,"The underlying study is not sufficiently conclusive to be able to determine such an effect. Currently, there is no high-quality scientific study that has investigated this issue."
259,Can phthalates cause diabetes?,"The authors of two recently published studies found significantly higher concentrations of phthalates in the body in diabetic patients than in those without diabetes [1] [2]. No direct evidence for diabetes cause, but indications Even if there are increased concentrations of various phthalates in the body in diabetics as well as in people with a diabetes precursor – this is not proof that phthalates trigger diabetes.",yes,"Studies conducted in humans to date show that people with diabetes or pre-diabetes have significantly elevated phthalate concentrations in their bodies. Although these studies cannot prove that diabetes is caused or contributed to by phthalates, results from laboratory studies in the test tube and in animals point in this direction. However, studies over longer periods of time are needed to confirm this."
260,Does staining brain tumors with the dye aminolevulinic acid before surgery help patients survive longer?,"Partial success, but increase in survival rate unclear For the use of aminolevulic acid especially in brain tumors, only a larger study was conducted [ 1 ]. It is unclear whether the operation with the aid of aminolevulic acid leads to a greater number of long-term cured patients.",unknown,"Surgery of brain tumors stained with aminolevulinic acid is more complete than without staining. Although the tumor returned in fewer patients in the initial period after surgery, it is unclear whether the long-term survival rate is also greater."
261,"Can exercise prevent premature deaths from heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and pre-diabetes as effectively as medication?","However, the fact that sport alone can reduce the risk of death for people with a heart attack is not entirely certain [1]. However, the direct comparison between sports and medications clearly revealed the drug as the winner for people with heart failure: In the long-term use of dewatering drugs (diuretics), only about a quarter of so many patients died early than in regular exercise. Sport beneficial, but no substitute for medication The analysis [1] provides first, cautious results. The authors also point out that studies on sport are missing as an alternative treatment method. It is still too early to say whether sport is suitable for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases or diabetes precursors instead of drugs.",yes,"An evaluation of several meta-analyses provides evidence that exercise can prevent premature death after stroke. After heart attacks or in cases of pre-diabetes, exercise appears to be similarly effective to the corresponding drugs. In the case of heart failure, however, medication is likely to be more effective. However, it is by no means possible to generalize from this that sport can replace medication."
262,Can taking the enzyme diamino oxidase prevent alcohol-related hangover symptoms?,"Two of the capsules containing the active substance diamino-oxidase (DAO) – taken before drinking alcohol – should not even cause or at least partially prevent hangover symptoms the next morning – one learns something disillusioned at the end of the courier article by a university professor. Therefore, the manufacturer's claim that its DAO-contained product can reduce or even prevent the unpleasant consequences of excessive consumption of alcohol is not scientifically substantiated.",unknown,"Such an effect is not likely, nor do clinical studies exist on this issue."
263,Can an anti-oxidant such as pseudocatalase stop or reverse hair graying?,Whether pseudocatalase can return its colour to gray hair due to age (which only appear grey but are actually white) has not been investigated.,unknown,This question has not yet been scientifically investigated and therefore cannot be answered.
264,Can sexual activity relieve headaches?,"Instead of the 60 colported, only 44 out of 100 migraine patients – less than half – actually noticed at least sometimes a relief of their pain. In some one third of respondents, sexual activities occasionally resulted in improvement, but in half of them a worsening of the symptoms.",unknown,"Individuals report subjective improvement. However, reliable scientific evidence that sexual activity in general can relieve migraine and cluster headaches is insufficient."
265,Does transcranial direct current stimulation help against severe depression?,"tDCS therefore shows little success in the treatment of severe depression. While the effect of tDCS is unclear, a number of active substances and psychotherapeutic procedures have been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe depression.",unknown,"A brand new review shows that tDCS does not lead to lasting improvement in patients with major depression, nor is the response to therapy better than to placebo treatment. However, the number of participants, both overall and in the individual studies, is too low for a reliable assessment."
266,Is the success of conventional treatment of a herniated disc equivalent to that of disc surgery?,"The pain was shown to decrease faster after surgery than with conventional treatment methods. Intervertebral disc surgery is also much more expensive than conventional therapy. However, the scientific evidence that operations do not bring an advantage in the long term compared to conventional treatment methods is low, as there are few studies of high quality.",yes,"Disc surgery leads to faster pain relief in the short term, but in most cases is unlikely to bring any long-term benefit compared to conventional therapy. It is also more expensive and somewhat riskier."
267,Does regular use of sleeping pills promote the risk of death or cancer?,"According to an article in the Kronen newspaper, such sleeping pills are said to be responsible for many deaths. Although the risk of developing cancer was much less increased, the study showed a clear correlation between the intake of more than 130 tablets per year and the risk of developing cancer. The authors of the study suspect that sleeping drugs, for example due to the drowsiness they sometimes cause, can lead to more dangerous falls or fatal accidents. Also a connection with a higher rate of depression among people taking sleeping pills and thus a higher proportion of suicides as a result of depression is not excluded. Although the authors of the study [ 1 ] have ruled out many other diseases as a probable reason for the significantly increased risk of death and cancer, an absolutely safe proof that sleeping agents are the cause of this, they still cannot provide their findings.",yes,"There is a connection between the use of sleeping pills and an increased risk of death or cancer. However, it cannot be ruled out with certainty that other reasons are not responsible for this increased risk."
268,Does increased time outdoors inhibit myopia in children?,"In most of these studies [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 ], various research groups discovered a connection between the extent of shortsightedness and the time spent by children and adolescents in closed spaces rather than outdoors. In two studies [ 8, 9 ] there was also no connection between increased outdoor activity and reduced short-sightedness.",yes,"There is probably a correlation between reduced myopia and outdoor activities. However, it is not possible to say beyond doubt whether increased time spent outdoors is actually the cause of reduced myopia. Various other factors also play a role in the development of myopia."
269,Do household cleaners and room fresheners in spray form cause damage to the heart?,"Risk to the heart little investigated The impact of detergents or household sprays on the cardiovascular system has so far been little investigated. In particular, there was a strong correlation between abnormal heart rhythm and the use of fresh cleaning and space sprays, while the regular use of other perfumed household products was not accompanied by an unusual pattern of heartbeat. Whether household sprays can directly increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases, however, cannot be derived from this with certainty. Conclusion Whether household cleaners can affect heart health is not yet certain, a study that not only investigates ECG abnormalities but also the actual incidence of cardiovascular diseases after regular household cleaner use would be necessary.",unknown,"There is evidence that people who often use household sprays more often have asymptomatic abnormalities of the heart rhythm. However, whether these abnormalities will later lead to disease, and whether household sprays are actually the cause, remains to be determined by larger and longer studies. Many, but not all, studies also show a connection between the frequent use of cleaning agents and an increased risk of asthma - even if other causes of this respiratory disease cannot be completely ruled out."
270,Can exercise improve mental performance impaired by alcohol consumption?,"Because if these parameters are included in the calculations, the difference between the athletes and the non-sportsmen disappears.",unknown,"There are only two studies that deal with this issue. Only one examines the problem in humans, and that is only a small pilot study. Whether sport reduces alcohol-related brain damage has not been clarified."
271,Can over-the-counter combination medications help with tension headache and migraine better than medications containing only single active ingredients?,"In addition to the good suitability of ASA, Diclofenac and Ibuprofen alone, the effectiveness of the combination of acetylsalycilic acid (ASS), paracetamol and caffeine is highlighted. According to a study in migraine, this combination of three was better than ibuprofen alone. Combination preparations with caffeine therefore have a slightly better effect than those without caffeine. Therefore, the question of which active substances or combination is the most effective cannot be answered. Proportionally well-proven is that caffeine as an addition to common painkillers can increase its effect slightly.",yes,"The addition of caffeine may slightly increase the effect of common painkillers in some people. The combination of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), paracetamol and caffeine is possibly the most effective. However, no better tolerability of the combination preparations was found. However, no comparative data are yet available for several other active ingredients or combinations of active ingredients."
272,Does hyperthermia treatment support chemotherapy in fighting cancer? (anonymous request with link to the Standard article),"Hyperthermia seems to be able to suppress cancers in some cases. According to a systematic review by Cochrane Collaboration [5], hyperthermia in gastric cancer as an addition to normal cancer treatment could prolong patients' lifetime. Conclusion There is a weak scientific evidence for the effectiveness of hyperthermia in the treatment of some cancers.",yes,"There are indications that hyperthermia can increase survival rates in some types of cancer. Overall, there are still too few large studies available to be able to make definite statements."
273,Can stress promote dementia?,"However, according to the Internet magazine Vorarlberg Online, stress is also the most common reason for the emergence of dementia. However, studies suggest that permanent performance pressure as one of many factors could be partly responsible for the development of age dementia [1] [2] [3] [4]. This suggests that the subjectively perceived stress level is more decisive for the risk of dementia than the actual workload. Diabetes, depression, elevated cholesterol levels and smoking are among the factors that could also favour Alzheimer's disease [6].",yes,"There is evidence that chronic stress in work and private life may increase the risk of dementia in old age. However, this needs to be confirmed by larger studies. However, stress is only one of many possible influences."
274,Does the risk for the unborn child to develop asthma later on increase if the mother is exposed to high pollen concentrations during pregnancy?,"However, the association with the increased pollen exposure does not exclude other causes of the increased asthma risk. There is uncertainty about the cause of allergies and, subsequently, asthma.",unknown,It is not clear whether a child later has an increased risk of asthma if its mother has contact with large amounts of pollen during pregnancy. Studies to date on this are rare and in some cases show methodological weaknesses.  Studies conducted according to strict criteria would be necessary to answer this question unequivocally.
275,Are children conceived in May more likely to be born prematurely than children conceived in other months?,A new study [1] sees flu as a danger for children born in May. The authors see the reason for the premature birth of children born in May as the occurrence of the flu. So influenza could be the trigger for premature births born in May. Premature births by temperature The meta-analysis [2] suggests that the time of birth may depend on the temperature.,yes,"There are indications that children conceived in May are born prematurely. The reason for this could be the flu, which hits May babies the hardest. The temperature can also influence the time of birth."
276,Does osteopathy work?,"Both chronic and acute back pains are common reasons to visit osteopaths, but recent reviews contradict some of the work of 2010 and do not find any reliable efficacy, at least for acute symptoms [2]. In chronic complaints, osteopathy is as successful as other therapies, thus comparable to physiotherapy; the effectiveness compared to sham treatment has not been established [3]. Other overviews have narrowed the term osteopathy: Paul Posadzki and Edzard Ernst investigated the study situation on efficacy in musculoskeletal pain, but distinguished between chiropractic and osteopathic and analysed only studies on osteopathic therapies [6] : Although aching muscles and joints are virtually the special field of osteopaths, the authors conclude that efficacy is not sufficiently proven; only in five out of 16 studies osteopathy was better than sham treatment.",yes,"For some therapies that fit under the broad term osteopathy, the evidence of studies indicates efficacy for back pain and some forms of headache; however, evidence of efficacy is lacking for many forms of osteopathy."
277,Do creams with sterol compounds improve the appearance of cellulite skin?,"Since no scientific literature has been found on the issue and the study of the German testing institute has serious deficiencies, there is no evidence of the efficacy of sterol-containing anti-cellulite creams.",unknown,There is no evidence for such an effect.
278,"For women at high risk of breast cancer, does a precautionary mastectomy make more sense than regular participation in intensive screening?","A direct comparison of the methods ""Screening"" and ""Precautionary breast removal"" is not possible on the basis of the current study situation: randomized-controlled studies are unthinkable, because even if the treatments to be compared are similarly effective, a random attribution to a treatment form would of course be unethical.",unknown,"High-risk patients can significantly reduce their risk of breast cancer with preventive breast screening. Nevertheless, no general recommendation can be derived from this, as intensive screening programs are an alternative. However, good long-term studies are still lacking for both preventive measures, and the decision can only be made on a very individual basis."
279,Does tocilizumab specifically help children with rheumatoid arthritis (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) ?,"Although the data from the two children's studies are not as reliable as those from the larger and more numerous studies in adults, tocilizumab may be more effective in children with systemic JIA than in adults with rheumatic arthritis.",yes,"In contrast to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, where the efficacy of tocilizumab has been well studied, there are only 2 controlled studies for use in children on a specific subtype (systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) with very few participants. These suggest better efficacy than in adults, but in reality this is likely to be lower than presented in the study results. In addition, the drug can also cause severe side effects."
280,Does the Toxoplasma gondii parasite affect suicide rates?,"The study [1] cited in the newspaper article also finds a connection between infection and violence against mothers themselves, but this study cannot exclude possible other factors of influence.",yes,"Meanwhile, some studies show a link between infection with the protozoan T. gondii and a higher suicide rate. However, it is not yet clear whether the parasite actually has an influence, because a third factor is also conceivable that influences both the infection rate and the suicide rate."
281,Is Exemestane better than other hormone-altering drugs for reducing the risk of breast cancer or treating it?,"Therefore, it cannot be answered whether exemestan works better for the treatment of breast cancer than other aromatase inhibitors other than anastrozole. There are still too few data to compare different aromatase inhibitors with respect to their side effects.",yes,"The group of so-called aromatase inhibitors, which includes Exemestane, causes a higher survival rate in the treatment of breast cancer patients than other hormone-influencing drugs. Exemestane probably does not work any better than the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. Whether Exemestane works better compared to other aromatase inhibitors is still unclear."
282,Does a newly approved contraceptive pill with the active ingredient combination nomegestrol acetate and 17ß-estradiol have fewer undesirable side effects than other birth control pills?,"Conclusion Although the benefits of the new pill are mentioned only cautiously in both newspaper articles, there are no scientific facts that indicate fewer side effects, lower exposure to the liver or a reduced risk of thrombosis. Also, the fact that the use of natural estradiol as estrogen hormone instead of usual ethinyl estradiol has significant advantages cannot be proven from the study data.",no,"Compared to two other birth control pills available in pharmacies, side effects such as acne, weight gain or headaches occur just as often or even more frequently with the newly approved pill. Even if some blood values are somewhat more favorable, it is unclear whether the slightly increased risk of thrombosis generally associated with birth control pills is actually lower with the new preparation."
283,Does PrEP reduce the risk of HIV infection?,The evaluation showed that the risk of HIV infection in the PrEP users was significantly reduced.,yes,"Studies to date have confirmed the preventive effect. People who take PrEP medication correctly have a significantly lower risk of HIV infection. However, infection cannot be completely ruled out."
284,"Does exercise, a restricted diet, or both together help prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy?",The studies in detail Whether exercise programs or a diet change can protect expectant mothers from excessive weight gain is well investigated.,yes,"The summarized results of previous studies clearly show this. However, it is less well established that the measures also improve the health of mother and child during pregnancy and birth."
285,Does taking antibiotics for acute sinusitis speed up the healing of the infection?,"They say that antibiotics can shorten acute sinus inflammation a little – but only in a few people. Sickness duration: only 5 out of 100 benefit What is the benefit of taking an antibiotic on the cure, i.e. This means that only 5 out of 100 people with acute rhinosinusitis benefit from taking an antibiotic instead of a dummy medication.",yes,"Taking antibiotics can somewhat speed up the healing of an acute sinus infection. However, the success rate is not exhilarating: antibiotics lead to a faster recovery in only 5 out of 100 people. Pain and impairment in everyday life are not improved. And, of course, antibiotics can cause side effects. All in all, antibiotics often don't have much benefit in acute sinusitis."
286,Does colonoscopy reduce mortality from colorectal cancer?,"[a] There is good evidence for the effectiveness of small colonoscopy: A review of the 2013 Cochrane Collaboration shows that it can reduce the risk of colon cancer by about a third [1]. Thus, all possible cancer precursors can never be discovered with certainty – only for this reason the claim that one can virtually eradicate colon cancer with this preventive measure is clearly too high. The colonoscopy is an effective method to achieve optimum benefit with minimal side effects, but still requires a lot of research, even if it takes very long-term investigations to obtain clear results.",yes,"For the small colonoscopy (sigmoidoscopy) an effectiveness is well proven, whether the large colonoscopy (colonoscopy) works even better is not proven. It is not possible that colorectal cancer could be prevented entirely."
287,Do nicotine replacement products like nicotine gum or nicotine patches help with long-term smoking cessation?,"Those who called for additional support, such as consultations and discussions with professionals, could further improve the chances of a smoke stop.",yes,"The benefits of nicotine replacement have been proven in numerous studies. Compared to a placebo, more people manage not to smoke after six months or longer. The success can even be increased somewhat by additional support (counseling, talks)."
288,"Is short, high-intensity training equally effective as longer, moderate-intensity training?",Whether the fitness level remains comparable over a long period of time had not been investigated in any of the studies.,yes,"Yes, possibly. However, there are only a few studies on this, some of which are inadequate. Possible side effects have not been studied."
289,Do behavioral therapy methods help with specific fears (phobias) such as fear of spiders?,"The basic principle of behavioral therapy in the treatment of phobias is the habit of getting used to fear. The most effective is the direct confrontation with the fear trigger [1] [2] [3], i.e.",yes,"Yes, the most effective method is confrontation therapy. Patients are confronted with the fear-inducing stimulus (e.g., a spider) more and more until they have become accustomed to it."
290,"Can honey accelerate the healing of second degree burns with pain, redness and blisters?","And these are very different for different types of wound, as a summary of the well-made studies published until 2014 shows [1]: Well proven by now, honey can reduce the healing duration of moderate burns – also called second-degree burns, in which the upper skin layers are affected – by an average of four to five days compared to other non-honey-free associations.",yes,"With honey, moderately severe burns that affect the uppermost layers of the skin and can also lead to wound infections heal four to five days faster than with conventional burn treatments. Whether honey also provides benefits for small, fresh wounds is insufficiently researched. Hard-to-heal (chronic) wounds on legs or feet may not be better treated with honey than with other remedies. There are also indications that honey dressings could lead to more pain here."
291,"Does honey heal small, fresh wounds faster than the usual wound treatment?","And these are very different for different types of wound, as a summary of the well-made studies published until 2014 shows [1]: Well proven by now, honey can reduce the healing duration of moderate burns – also called second-degree burns, in which the upper skin layers are affected – by an average of four to five days compared to other non-honey-free associations.",unknown,"With honey, moderately severe burns that affect the uppermost layers of the skin and can also lead to wound infections heal four to five days faster than with conventional burn treatments.

There are also indications that honey dressings could lead to more pain here."
293,Does sitting for long periods despite compensatory exercise increasingly lead to type 2 diabetes?,It is therefore also not possible to determine whether movement can reduce the risk of diabetes. Conclusion The present studies do not show how much exercise can compensate for the increased risk of diabetes of predominantly sedentary activity.,unknown,"Prolonged sitting and an inactive lifestyle lead to a significantly increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Exercise has a beneficial effect in the prevention of diabetes. Whether physical activity can completely offset the risk of a predominantly sedentary lifestyle, or the extent to which this would be necessary, is not clear from the available studies."
294,Do acupuncture or related smoking cessation methods help you stay smoke-free for at least 6 months?,"The acupuncture-like mesotherapy for quitting smoking, which was addressed in News, has not yet been investigated in any scientific study – a statement of its effectiveness is therefore currently not possible. In summary, there is currently no clear objective, non-contradictory evidence that acupuncture methods can facilitate the cessation of smoking. In addition, nicotine substitute gums turned out to be more effective than acupuncture.",yes,"There is no evidence for a long-lasting success of smoking cessation with the help of acupuncture or similar methods. In the short term, acupuncture might help slightly. Overall, however, acupuncture is clearly inferior to nicotine replacement therapy."
295,Do gastrointestinal surgeries (bariatric surgeries) improve symptoms of type 2 diabetes?,"2011) reports on ""bariatric surgery"" – a specialist vocabulary for gastrointestinal weight loss surgery – as an effective measure to improve diabetes symptoms. Result: Gastric surgery helps with type 2 diabetes Three systematic overviews and meta-analysis [3] [4] [6] clearly show that gastric surgery for weight loss can reduce or even fix the symptoms of diabetes. Symptoms of diabetes disappear temporarily or permanently in 80 out of 100 patients after a gastric bypass [3]. Conclusion Gastrointestinal surgery, usually used for weight loss, can also effectively relieve or resolve the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These can also relieve diabetes symptoms, but less effective than surgery [6].",yes,"Gastrointestinal surgery significantly improves diabetes symptoms in the majority of overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. However, these operations are associated with risks. Other methods (such as exercise programs or weight reduction without surgery) are effective to a lesser extent, but are far less risky."
296,Is there a connection between ADHD and neurodermatitis?,"Jochen Schmitt, Director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Health Care at the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, is attributed in the article to the statement that neurodermatitis increases the risk of ADHD disease by around 50 percent, especially if the disease occurs already in the first two years of life. The probability that a child with previous or current neurodermatitis is diagnosed with ADHD or ADHD symptoms determined from these studies is increased by 43 percent [1]. The same team has already described a link between ADHD and neurodermatitis in a systematic review in 2010 [2]. A current cross-sectional study from Taiwan [3] also finds a connection in the analysis of data from 8201 ADHD patients, which indicates an approximately 50 percent increased ADHD risk for children with neurodermatitis. Because whether the neurodermatitis actually has a causal effect is unclear – the mechanism that connects the two diseases is unknown, as both Schmitt [1] and the study from Taiwan [3] emphasize.",yes,Several large studies show that there is a link between ADHD and neurodermatitis. Whether one disease is the cause of the other or whether both diseases have common causes is not yet clear.
297,Can injections with the enzyme collagenase straighten fingers bent by Dupuytren's disease without surgery? (Reader inquiry),"Result: Collagenase with temporary efficacy... 3 smaller [ 2, 4, 5 ] and a larger randomized-controlled study (the latter with around 300 participants [ 6 ]) demonstrate the principle efficacy of collagenase injections in advanced Dupuytren's disease. ... and very common side effects Undesirable side effects occurred in almost all patients [ 5, 6 ].",yes,"Collagenase injections can straighten the fingers, but success does not always occur and is usually - as with the usual surgery - not permanent. Almost all patients experience undesirable side effects, which can also be severe in individual cases."
298,Do mindfulness-based methods effect improvement in chronic pain?,"4 of the 7 studies (Teixeica 2010, Morone 2009, Plews-Ogan 2005 and Wong 2009) could not detect any benefit from the treatment of chronic pain with mindfulness-based methods compared to sham therapy, ordinary pain treatment or information presentations. Although the results of a study (by Morone in 2008) indicated no improvement in pain perception through a mindfulness-based program, patients with chronic back pain could better accept their pain at the end of the 8-week therapy. Mindfulness-based meditation and methods based on mindfulness-based stress reduction seem to be able to make pain more bearable in some cases. The effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapies for the treatment of chronic pain is therefore uncertain.",unknown,"Some clinical studies suggest an efficacy of mindfulness-based methods for pain management, but several other studies cannot confirm such an effect. A definitive answer could come from studies with a larger number of participants."
299,Does high air pollution increase the risk for the unborn to develop autism later in life?,"The results of a new study are disturbing: fine particles from diesel gases and air pollutants such as mercury are supposed to double the risk of giving birth to an autistic child [1]. Link with air pollutants unclear The authors of the study mentioned in the media [1] compared air pollution in the vicinity of the residences of 325 autistic children with that of 22 101 healthy children. They found that in areas with a high proportion of diesel gases and other pollutants, significantly more children are born, who are later diagnosed with autism. In another study there was a connection between air pollution from heavy metals, diesel soot and chlorine-containing solvent vapours and the more frequent birth of autistic children. So whether it is actually the air pollution that increases the risk of the emergence of autism needs to be clarified by more detailed studies.",unknown,"There may be a link between the increased incidence of autism and air pollution during pregnancy. However, previous studies have been too imprecise to actually identify air pollution as a cause of autism. The possible risk should be clarified by more detailed studies."
300,Is it harmful to health to eat apple cores with the apple?,"Even if you eat an apple and accidentally break a kernel, there is no danger, because the seeds contain very little amygdalin. Studies that indicate an increased health risk from apple seeds are not found. There are also no studies of an increased risk of cancer by eating apple seeds.",no,"Normally, apple cores pass through the body undigested. Even if they are bitten, not enough poison enters the body to pose a danger."
301,Can taking selenium prevent cancer?,"In the overview, the work comes to a clear and trustworthy conclusion: Selenium does not protect against cancer. The conclusion therefore: The intake of selenium as a dietary supplement cannot reduce the risk of cancer.",no,"The summarized results of studies conducted so far reliably show that selenium preparations do not protect against cancer. However, the dose at which selenium becomes harmful to the body is insufficiently researched."
302,Does mesotherapy help against pain?,"Herbs and turnips In mesotherapy, many small stitches are used to administer a drug to the skin in the immediate vicinity of the affected region – with each single stitch a small dose is inserted into a specific skin depth. Many stitches, few studies As extensive as the approaches are, the study situation is limited, for almost all forms of mesotherapy lacks evidence of effectiveness, for the treatment of pain there are at all few studies to be found. A study from 2010 [1] confirms that mesotherapy has the same effectiveness as standard therapy – the use of corticosteroids and other pain and inflammation inhibitors in the form of tablets and syringes.",no,"Mesotherapy is an umbrella term for very different treatments that have only the method of administration in common, namely the injection of many small doses of an agent into a specific skin layer. Therefore, it is not possible to make a general statement about its effectiveness. Some studies indicate that it can be a useful way of administering established medications for certain complaints."
303,Do general health checkups lead to longer life?,"Thus, general health checks do not provide a longer life. The authors of the review work [1] thus attest to health checks that they miss their goal – a healthier population.",no,Health screenings for adults from the general population do not have the hoped-for effect: participants do not live longer as a result of serial screening and preventive care.
304,Can dementia be prevented?,"Prevention only possible The fact that the development of dementia, such as Alzheimer's, can be prevented is not scientifically assured. However, the authors of this review found indications that the following factors might actually reduce the risk of dementia: Regular sports Occupation with mental-demanding activities High educational standard Many social contacts, living together with partners A balanced diet with lots of vegetables and fruits, nuts, olive oil and cereals, more fish than meat and moderate alcohol consumption ( Mediterranean diet ) The following factors could potentially increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease: Diabetes Smoking Depressive disease Head injuries Pesticides Low educational standard Few social contacts Low scientific evidence For all these possible protection and risk factors, however, the scientific evidence is low – new studies will certainly have an important influence on the assessment of risk reduction or increase. Regular sports, a healthy Mediterranean diet, the prevention of obesity and thus of diabetes as well as quitting smoking are in any case a good idea to do something good to your body – even if it is not clear whether this can also prevent dementia.",no,"It is possible that sport and exercise, mentally demanding activities, a busy social life and a Mediterranean diet could prevent dementia. It is possible that diabetes, smoking, depression, loneliness, head injuries and pesticides increase the risk of dementia. However, all these factors are not well established."
305,Does the plant pigment beta-carotene protect against cancer?,"Result: No protection against cancer Three systematic overviews and meta-analysis [1] [2] [3] summarize the results of several studies on the impact of beta-carotene on the risk of the development of different types of cancer. In particular, for risk groups such as heavy smokers, the likelihood of developing these types of cancer is similar to those who do not consume beta-carotene as a dietary supplement. Overall, the use of beta-carotene as a dietary supplement to prevent cancer is therefore not helpful and, due to a potentially increased risk of cancer in risk groups or high doses, the authors of two systematic reviews [1] [3] do not recommend it.",no,"There is no evidence of a cancer risk-reducing effect for beta-carotene. On the contrary, beta-carotene preparations may even increase the risk of bladder cancer and cancer in smokers."
306,Can vitamin supplements protect against life-threatening diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular disease?,"People who have no nutrient deficiency and are otherwise healthy will not benefit from the intake of vitamin preparations. Possible exception Vitamin D An exception with many limitations is only vitamin D. In the case of elderly people, regular intake in the form of vitamin D3 can probably actually increase life expectancy somewhat. However, to a limited extent: only one in 150 people who take a vitamin D3 preparation for five years ultimately lives longer than without the drug [5]. With sufficient sunlight, the skin can produce this vitamin itself in the form of vitamin D3, but it can also be absorbed via food as vitamin D2 or D3. Vitamin D is responsible, among other things, for the regulation of the calcium budget and thus for the bone build-up.",no,"Antioxidant and multivitamin supplements do not reduce the likelihood of dying prematurely from cancer, cardiovascular disease, or other causes. Taking beta-carotene and possibly vitamin E may actually increase the likelihood of premature death. The only exception is vitamin D supplements; they are likely to have a small life-prolonging effect in the elderly."
307,Is it true that lowering cholesterol does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"Study participants who consumed less salt and fat, but more fruits, vegetables and fiber, were able to lower their LDL cholesterol levels and blood pressure slightly. Especially a Mediterranean diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, olive oil and fish as well as little red meat and dairy products seems to have a positive effect on heart health. However, this does not mean that all cholesterol-lowering agents automatically reduce the cardiovascular risk. Cholesterol only one of many heart risk factors Cholesterol is by no means the only factor that increases the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. Quitting smoking also significantly reduces the risk, even if it does not affect cholesterol levels.",no,"No. High cholesterol, along with other risk factors, can increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. If the proportion of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood is lowered (with medication or through a change in diet), the risk of diseases such as heart attack or stroke also decreases."
308,Do static magnets help against pain?,"Magnets are pure magic – with an invisible hand they attract something, push each other off and in a large style they even let whole moves float. Does the magic of magnets also affect the human body? There they are supposed to calm pain, heal wounds, protect against joint wear (arthrosis) or simply improve the general well-being. Effekt refuted In 2007, an overview of the studies on magnets against pain was summarized [1] : The result shows that magnets do not work better than a sham treatment (placebo). The question is important in that it is estimated that almost a third of all osteoarthritis patients in the USA use magnets in some form [1].",no,Both a somewhat older review and several high-quality randomized controlled trials show that magnets do not work better than sham treatment.
309,Does hypnosis help with chronic bowel problems?,"At first glance, numerous studies indicate that hypnosis therapy is helpful in the case of intestinal problems, even systematic overviews come to this conclusion [1] [2] [3]. A new study from Vienna [3] also demonstrates an improvement in the quality of life by hypnosis therapy after one year, but many patients no longer completed the questionnaire at the end of the study, i.e. In hypnosis (in hypnotic trance), attention is focused primarily on a particular point in which much of the other perceptions and thoughts are hidden. A slight hypnotic trance can also be experienced in everyday life, such as jogging. In hypnosis the patient is not willless, his protective mechanisms also work in trance [5].",yes,"Since 1984, studies have shown a success of hypnosis against intestinal complaints. However, the studies have only been conducted on small groups of patients and also show methodological weaknesses. Thus, there is only little evidence of efficacy."
310,Does taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy increase the risk of food allergy for the unborn child?,In order to prevent Rachitis – a bone softening in children – several scientific societies recommend administering vitamin D as a dietary supplement to infants and children in a lower-than-sun range [7]. Too much of the vitamin can cause food allergies in the child. Neither very low nor very high levels of vitamin D in the mother's blood or the umbilical cord at birth indicated food allergies in the first two years of life. The role of vitamin D is also unclear as a possible trigger of other types of allergy. Some countries also enrich foods such as milk or orange juice with vitamin D to prevent deficiency (e.g.,unknown,"Whether vitamin D supplements can increase the risk of food allergy in the unborn child is unclear, as studies on this issue have yielded conflicting results."
311,Is combined hormone therapy with estrogen and progestin safe for women in late menopause (after the last menstrual period)?,"Therefore, it is essential that women taking hormones in particular be informed about possible serious disadvantages, especially if they are taken over a longer period of time. Apart from this, women have a higher risk of stroke in oestrogen hormone therapy, as well as women with combination drugs, and otherwise the side-effect profile is similar. Whether women who start hormone treatment in this window of time are actually better protected from some diseases, however, is not well researched until today and not clear [2]. Among other things, the authors were interested in the advantages and disadvantages of hormone therapy for women after menopause. Hormone therapy increases the risk of serious diseases.",no,"Hormone therapy with estrogen- and progestin-containing preparations makes women more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack. The risk of breast cancer is also increased. The hormone drugs probably protect a little against diabetes, colon cancer or bone fractures. However, they are no good as a preventive medicine because of the list of side effects. Women who want to relieve their menopausal symptoms with hormone preparations should carefully weigh up the possible benefits and risks with their doctor."
312,Can negative expectancy reduce the effect of pain medications?,"Benefits and damage from nothing In randomized controlled studies, the nocebo effect can be observed well.",no,"Studies clearly show that ineffective placebo can bring severe side effects, depending on the patient's expectations. One effect can also be that the effectiveness of painkillers is limited."
313,Is sex as good an endurance workout as running?,"Canadian researchers compared the energy consumption during sex with a moderate training on a treadmill [1]. The result: In a sexual act, both men and women consume significantly less calories on average than in a half-hour treadmill training [1]. According to study authors, the performance would be roughly like a leisurely walk. One person found that sex was not more beneficial than treadmill training, whether woman or man is not stated.",no,"Studies show that physical exertion during sex is present but rather moderate. Compared with targeted exercise, the energy expenditure is lower."
314,Can electrical brain stimulation reduce the amount of food eaten?,"In two of these [3] [4], the researchers let their subjects eat buffets at will, both after a dummy treatment and after a real electrical brain stimulation. The result: in one of the two studies [3] the tDCS treatment caused the subjects to eat less compared to the dummy treatment. Despite the contradictory results, the participants of both studies indicated that they felt less cravings if they had previously received electrical brain stimulation. Magnetic brain stimulation (rTMS) does not seem to be able to mitigate these ""eating attacks"", according to the cautious results of two small studies [2]. Adverse reactions of electrical brain stimulation TDCS were approximately as common in patients treated with sham in clinical trials conducted so far.",unknown,"Electrical brain stimulation may be able to reduce short-term cravings for high-calorie foods. However, it is unclear that the treated persons actually eat less of them; study results on this are contradictory."
315,Are plastic kitchen boards more hygienic than wooden ones?,"A thorough search for studies on this issue reveals contradictory results. Some laboratory studies [1-3] [8,9] seem to show that wooden boards are definitely not more hygienic than artificial boards, but in other studies there are no hygiene differences: wooden boards could be released from bacteria as well as plastic [4,5] [7]. On the other hand, wooden boards had been used much less frequently by the Salmonella sufferers.",unknown,Whether wooden boards in the kitchen have hygienic disadvantages is unclear. Previous studies on this are too contradictory to answer this question clearly.
316,Does excessive beer or alcohol consumption lead to obesity?,"In some studies, it seems to be exactly the opposite, beer lovers weigh less than little drinkers at the time of the survey. In such a study, men who drank less than three litres a week even seemed to lose weight, and not to increase in weekly amounts of six litres or more. Studies comparing beer with other non-alcoholic beverages other than non-alcoholic beer do not show a clear difference in weight. One reason, according to the authors of an overview of 2011 [2], could be that wine drinkers may tend to become a healthier diet overall. It is also possible that alcohol only has an influence on fat folds on the abdomen and hips from a large amount of time, but it does not lead to weight gain in moderation.",unknown,"In some studies, alcohol consumption does seem to be related to weight gain. In other studies, however, there is either no effect or even the opposite effect. The study situation is contradictory."
317,Do omega-3 fatty acids or a diet rich in fish help with rheumatoid arthritis?,Is this supported by scientific data? Anti-rheumatism effect unproven A Korean team of researchers summarized the results of previously published randomized-controlled studies [1] that investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acid preparations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Their conclusion: there is no valid evidence for such a positive effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,unknown,"According to the majority of studies, preparations with omega-3 fatty acids cannot improve pain and other symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. However, the results are sometimes contradictory. The effectiveness of preparations made from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel is also unclear. Whether a diet rich in fish helps is insufficiently studied."
318,Does unprocessed red meat increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"They found no connection between the consumption of unprocessed red meat and heart disease. However, the study results contradict each other, so we do not know whether meat can actually cause cardiovascular disease [4]. Whether the cause of the increased probability of disease was actually the consumption of red meat cannot be determined from the study data.",unknown,"Whether unprocessed red meat increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease is unclear, and study results are conflicting. However, processed red meat such as ham, bacon or sausages could increase the risk."
319,"Does processed red meat (sausages, ham, bacon) increase the risk of cardiovascular disease???","Possible risk only for processed meat products Meat is not equal to meat. On closer examination, it can be seen that meat products processed with salt, smoked or cured meat may actually increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. A Polish-Swedish research team found a potentially increased probability of disease not only for processed meat products, but also for unprocessed red meat [1].",yes,"Whether unprocessed red meat increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease is unclear, and study results are conflicting. However, processed red meat such as ham, bacon or sausages could increase the risk."
320,Does hawthorn extract help patients with heart muscle weakness (heart failure)?,"Accordingly, it is also unclear over which time period and at which dose the herbal medicinal product should be taken and which patient groups could benefit from a hawthorn intake. In most studies, patients suffering from heart failure took hawthorn preparations as an accompanying therapy in addition to their cardiac medications. So we can't say whether the drug, the hawthorn extract or just the random factor affected the respective result. In fact, those patients who had taken hawthorn were less short of breath, more resilient and showed increased physical performance in the stress ECG. In this study, the intake of hawthorn did not improve the physical resilience or the quality of life of those affected.",unknown,The results of the studies found differ significantly and leave more questions open than they answer.
321,Is glyphosate carcinogenic?,"Of mice... in the debate about the different assessments, a lot is about studies in rats and mice. Animal studies play a greater role in assessing risks than when it comes to the effectiveness of drugs. Secondly, the animal studies show an increased risk of cancer only when the experimental animals receive a very high dose of glyphosate. ...and humans In addition to animal studies, there are numerous studies with people on glyphosate The IARC derives from studies in humans a low evidence of an increased risk. The disadvantage: not only the factor that you want to examine, but many other factors can influence the result – for example, when it comes to cancer, lifestyle, smoking, and much more play a role and, to a certain extent, mask the effect of glyphosate.",unknown,"Depending on how much animal experiments and laboratory tests are weighted against studies on humans, one arrives at different assessments. With regard to human studies, we consider the question to be unresolved at present."
322,Does psychotherapy help with burnout?,"Most of the studies on burnout symptoms deal with cognitive behavioral therapy. According to a systematic review [1] Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be able to alleviate the consequences of permanent stress in the longer term. Physiotherapy showed no better success than standard treatment in a study after six or twelve months. However, more studies would be needed to make a clear assessment.",yes,"Of the psychotherapy modalities, only Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has evidence of potential efficacy for burnout. For other forms of psychotherapy, the scientific evidence is unclear or non-existent."
323,Is electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) in combination with ordinary fitness training more efficient than fitness training alone?,"However, according to a meta-analysis summarising the results of 17 studies, the effect is no greater than in conventional strengthening exercises [ 1 ]. Full-body EMS as a fitness method hardly investigated While the electrical stimulation of individual muscle groups for therapeutic purposes was investigated by some research groups, there are hardly any scientific studies on the whole-body EMS as a fitness training replacement.",unknown,"There is evidence for the principle effectiveness of EMS for muscle strengthening. For a superiority of the combination of EMS and ordinary training compared to fitness training alone, the evidence is contradictory."
324,Can vitamin and nutrient supplements prevent the eye disease age-related macular degeneration?,"Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer. However, the fact that a vitamin mix seems to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is largely due to the results of a single study conducted by the US ""AREDS"" research team [1] [3]. This study examined a mixture of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc oxide and 2 mg copper oxide. It is well established that vitamin E and beta-carotene are not suitable for prevention – they cannot prevent the ocular disease from developing in old age.",no,"Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
325,Can they delay the progression of eye disease?,"Progress probably slows down In fact, the summarized results of previously published studies show that a combination of vitamin C, E, beta-carotene and zinc can probably maintain the increasingly deteriorating vision longer. For those with early signs of macular degeneration, this would mean: Without vitamins and minerals, the disease would progress strongly in 15 out of 1000 patients within six years With vitamins and minerals, it would be 11 out of 1000, i.e.",yes,"Vitamin E and beta-carotene cannot prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. However, in combination with zinc and vitamin C, they probably allow certain forms of an existing disease to progress somewhat more slowly."
326,Do milk or dairy products promote colon cancer and rectal cancer?,"For ovarian cancer, breast cancer and cancer of the uterine mucosa, the authors of extensive systematic reviews have so far found no evidence of a reduction in risk or an increase in risk [3] [4] [5]. However, the study situation is still too unclear to draw definitive conclusions, which requires more and more meaningful studies. There is also the possibility that dairy products will reduce the likelihood of bladder cancer.",no,"It is likely that dairy products reduce the risk of colon and rectal cancer, and possibly bladder cancer. However, very large amounts of milk & dairy products could possibly increase the risk of prostate cancer. It should be remembered that about the same number of men die from colon and rectal cancer as from prostate cancer. For breast and ovarian cancer and cancer of the endometrium, it is unclear whether cancer risk is affected by milk and dairy products."
327,Does yoga change the genetic makeup?,"The genes themselves remain unchanged, only their activity fluctuates; just as in each cell the activity of the different genes is adjusted according to current needs. The difference between a liver cell and a muscle cell is not due to different genes, but to different gene activity. The study shows that shortly after the activity, the gene activity differs from certain white blood cells in these two groups.",unknown,Yoga - like any other physical activity - can influence the activity of genes. But the genes themselves are not changed by it.
328,Which of the three most common laser eye surgeries produces the best results and has the fewest side effects?,"However, the study situation is still rather thin, new and large studies could still change somewhat in this assessment. At present, all three methods lead to very good results, which, according to the first long-term studies [3], are likely to be sustainable. Results from a few years ago are no longer meaningful today because the treatment method has changed. Long-term studies therefore always refer to the state of the art at that time, but already suggest that laser treatments are safe and sustainable [1] [2] [3].",yes,"If only new studies are considered, all three techniques are equally successful. Probable advantages of LASIK: less pain after surgery and good vision more quickly."
329,"Can electromagnetic fields with a specific pattern (pulsed electromagnetic fields, PEMF) heal injuries?","Evidence that this pattern in particular has a good therapeutic effect has not been provided. In fact, only a randomized-controlled study on fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) [1] and some laboratory results can be found. Apart from the fact that a study on fatigue in a particular disease naturally does not say anything about effects on completely different symptoms, this one study is not yet meaningful: there were very few participants (37) and the intake of medications differed in the experimental and control groups. Many approaches, little evidence Even if the whole variety of similar treatments is considered, there are not enough good studies to prove an effect of PEMF therapies. For a meaningful assessment of PEMF as a form of therapy, studies with good methodology, a higher number of participants and a comparison of the different forms of application (among others) are missing.",unknown,"No good injury studies can be found on the device. The only randomized-controlled study treats fatigue in patients with the incurable nerve disease multiple sclerosis and is not very conclusive. Even for the whole range of similar treatment methods, there is no sufficient evidence of efficacy."
330,Does the drug fingolimod reduce the progression of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis similarly or better than previous drugs?,"The recently newly approved active substance Fingolimod in Europe causes white blood cells (T cells) to be held back in the lymph nodes, which prevents them from causing inflammation by immigrating to the brain. By means of systematic literature research, we wanted to find out whether fingolimod is similar to or better than previous multiple sclerosis – drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease.",yes,"Two manufacturer-funded clinical trials attest Fingolimod such efficacy that exceeds that of interferon beta therapy. However, the drug can also cause serious side effects."
331,Can cancer be successfully fought with intentionally induced fever?,"==References== In the 19th century, the idea was born that fevers protect against cancer. No major modern studies have been conducted in which deliberately triggered fever has been tested as therapy.",unknown,"In the early 20th century, cancer was indeed sometimes fought with fever, sometimes successfully. But the therapies and trials are poorly documented and were risky. An assessment of efficacy is not possible based on the studies to date."
332,Can some forms of headache be successfully treated with heat?,"Accordingly, there is no scientific evidence of the effectiveness of this measure. However, there is no sufficient evidence to support this claim. A Cochrane overview work from 2004 [1] investigates all non-invasive physical treatment methods for all forms of headache: Heat treatment plays only a very small role according to this study (dryer is not mentioned) – heat was tested in combination with other measures: In one study, the combination of heat, home training and stretching is worse than a combination of biofeedback and relaxation.",unknown,"Heat on tense muscles is pleasant, but no evidence exists that the tension is released and the headache is relieved."
333,Does electro-acupuncture on the ear help against pain?,"Thus, the repeated electrical irritation of acupuncture points on the ear seems to be able to stop some chronic neck or cross pain [ 2, 3 ]. The pain could not be brought to total disappearance, but the study participants needed less painkillers than without electro-acupuncture over the duration of a few weeks. Acupuncture on the ear probably effective against pain Overall, different acupuncture methods on the ear may effectively reduce pain.",yes,"Electro-ear acupuncture could be supportive against chronic pain such as neck or low back pain. The method cannot completely replace painkillers. For surgery-related pain, the effectiveness is uncertain."
334,Does treatment with the new drug erenumab reduce the number of migraine days per month?,"In other words, compared to a sham medication, individuals with episodic migraines were spared on average 1 to 2 migraine days per month by erenumab [1-4]. So far no serious side effects The side effects of erenumab – as far as the earlier rather shorter studies at least – do not seem to be serious: those who used erenumab complained a little more frequently than those with the dummy medication about injection site reactions, constipation, muscle cramps and itching [6]. Because erenumab has so far only been compared with placebo. No long-term data The results on efficacy and safety first sound as if people with a similar condition as in the studies could actually benefit from erenumab.",yes,"In five studies available to date, which tend to be shorter, participants suffered from migraine less frequently with erenumab than with a placebo. The studies were of high methodological quality. In episodic migraine, people ""saved"" about 1 to 2 migraine days per month . For chronic migraine, sufferers had about 2.5 fewer days of pain per month. However, the efficacy and safety data relate to a maximum time frame of six months; the long-term benefit still needs to be explored. The benefit of erenumab compared to other established preventive migraine drugs has also not yet been researched."
335,Is screening by optical coherence tomography superior to conventional examinations for the early detection of diabetic macular edema?,"Early detection: Optical coherence tomography unreliable Most diabetes patients with such pathological retinal damage will not notice symptoms such as dark spots in the field of vision or impairment of sharp vision long after the start. However, laser treatment is not without risk, in some cases it may also result in an unwanted reduction in vision or other side effects that affect vision.",no,"No, screening by optical coherence tomography alone is too inaccurate. An examination using an ophthalmoscope and pupil dilating eye drops or with the help of fundus photography is a safer method."
336,Does the treatment of diabetes-related retinal diseases by injection of VEGF inhibitors provide an advantage compared to conventional laser treatment?,"The majority (5 out of 100 inhabitants) suffer from type 2 diabetes (formerly also called age diabetes), which is practically always lifestyle-related and in most cases is accompanied by overweight, one-sided diet and lack of exercise [ 4 ]. The presentation of the effectiveness of VEGF inhibitor injections as a new treatment method is also clearly exaggerated and biased – the newspaper article does not inform about risks and uncertainties.",yes,"There is evidence of better short-term efficacy for VEGF inhibitor injections compared with laser coagulation, but the method is insufficiently studied. Whether the effect is safe in the long term and effective at the same time is unclear."
337,Do saw palmetto preparations help with benign prostate enlargement?,"[4] [7] A well substantiated statement can only be made for saw palm preparations: A data analysis published in 2012 shows that these remedies do not work better than placebos and are therefore ineffective. However, it might be useful to continue to follow certain indications of symptom-improving plants and to compare them with new studies – at least in older studies, extracts of the African plum tree, willow grass pollen and the plant ingredient beta-sitosterin were considered safe and possibly effective. [updated and supplemented on March 1, 2015 with details on saw palm extracts, beta sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree and willow grass pollen extract] ( Author: J. Harlfinger, Review: B. Kerschner, C. Christof ) Recommend article:",no,"Many men with benign prostate enlargement turn to herbal remedies. However, current evidence for reliable and long-term efficacy is generally lacking, and most remedies are not well studied. It is therefore not possible to lump all products together. Preparations containing the plant ingredient beta-sitosterol, extracts of the African plum tree or ryegrass pollen extract could possibly lead to some improvement - however, this cautious assumption is based on outdated data. However, the current finding is this: remedies containing saw palmetto do not work any better than placebo and are thus considered ineffective."
338,"Do plant extracts of African plum tree, beta-sitosterol or ryegrass pollen extract (Cernilton) help benign prostate enlargement?","[5] Frustrating: most of the time evidence is missing Although some plants have been or are being traded as promising candidates in scientific literature: Unfortunately, up to now almost none of these products can provide up-to-date, sound evidence of good and long-term effectiveness.",unknown,"Many men with benign prostate enlargement turn to herbal remedies.

339,Does not wearing bras provide medical benefits?,"Our conclusion Scientific evidence on health advantages or disadvantages of bras is missing. Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2]. Thus, it remains unclear whether, for example, there would have been an improvement even without bra treatment. In the bra group, all women initially complained of a lack of comfort, but later 85 percent of patients reported an improvement in chest discomfort.",unknown,"Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies. Conversely, a few studies claim that well-fitting bras could prevent breast pain. However, the studies are methodologically weak and have virtually no validity."
340,Are there medical benefits to wearing a bra?,"No evidence that a bra changes the breast In our extensive searches, we only received one piece of work on the subject: in 1990 eleven women in Japan were examined how the consistent wearing of a strong supportive bra affects [1]. A change in shape of the chest by bras is thus not proven, just as no health benefits by omitting a bra. Instead, we found the opposite recommendation: women who occasionally suffer from aching breasts could allegedly get relief with a well-seated bra [5-7]. Whether wearing a bra helps against aching breasts is scientifically unproven. Also the studies, on the basis of which it is recommended to wear a well-seated bra in a painful breasts, are not meaningful: In a work already over 40 years old 114 women with a painful breast got to wear a well-suited bra, for which they could choose from 144 different sizes [2].",unknown,"Whether it is healthier or even beneficial not to wear a bra cannot be answered due to a lack of studies.

345,Do green tea products provide effective and safe support for weight loss?,"This is too short to judge the long-term success of weight loss. Overall, for the authors of this systematic survey, it remains questionable whether the investigated plant extracts can help with long-term weight loss and are also safe. [12] So there is no good evidence that at least the food supplements listed here can provide significant support in weight loss.",no,"Due to the number of studies, it is unclear for a number of supposedly appetite-suppressing dietary supplements whether they can support successful weight loss. Well-done studies that run over a long period of time with a sufficient number of test subjects are scarce. Evidence for long-term safety and simultaneous efficacy is therefore lacking."

For participants with a movement time up to 75 minutes of brisk walking per week, mortality fell by around 20 percent – in the model calculation this corresponds to 1.8 years. In both normal and overweight people, mortality decreased when the researchers compared slightly active (equivalent to approximately 140 minutes of brisk walking per week) with inactive people.",yes,"Several major studies have consistently concluded that physical activity reduces mortality. Even a brisk walk is enough. More helps more - but in any case, some exercise is much better than none at all."
348,Can arthroscopy reduce pain or improve mobility?,"Studies clearly speak against a benefit A research team summarized the most meaningful of all previously published studies on arthroscopy in knee arthritis.
