0,Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea better than a placebo?,"However, we are very sceptical here: we consider the results to be so little meaningful that we can neither see any evidence of effectiveness nor exclude it. In general, it remains questionable how reliable the results can be transferred to other situations where travel sickness occurs. However, we do not consider this assessment to be meaningful: the number of test subjects was far too small, and, therefore, the fluctuation range was far too large.",unknown,"The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
1,Does dimenhydrinate relieve travel nausea as well as the proven drug scopolamine???,"According to study authors, dimenhydrinate is supposed to help better than a placebo but has a worse effect than the proven drug Scopolamine.",unknown,"The best available studies on the subject are unfortunately not conclusive, for example because they were quite small and the publications lack many details for traceability.  Therefore, we can neither prove nor exclude an effect."
2,Does short-term fasting improve quality of life in cancer?,"On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life. In terms of quality of life, there are already contradictions within the individual studies: in the study [1b], in which the participants switched between fasting and non-fasting after half of the chemotherapy, only in one group did the quality of life improve during fasting, in the other the quality of life did not improve. Whether this is actually noticeable for cancer patients remains questionable.",unknown,We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
3,Does short-term fasting reduce the side effects of chemotherapy for cancer???,"On this basis, we cannot reliably say whether fasting during chemotherapy is actually useful or not, thus reducing side effects and improving the quality of life. Whether fasting prevents or mitigates the side effects of chemotherapy is also not clear from the results: In one of the studies [1a] there was no difference in side effects such as fatigue or nerve pain: they were similarly common and similarly severe in both groups. All of this means that the results of the studies are extremely uncertain and we cannot see or exclude the effectiveness of fasting.",unknown,We found only three very small studies on both questions. Their results are so unreliable that we cannot make any assessment. So we cannot say whether the quality of life of those affected is improved and whether fasting during chemotherapy reduces side effects.
4,Are extracts of Artemisa annua (annual mugwort) or the active ingredient artemisinin obtained from it effective against coronavirus?,"We have not found any studies to prevent Corona infection. However, it has several inconsistencies, so it cannot answer whether Artemisia helps the sick. However, the limited anti-malaria effect of artemisinin does not indicate efficacy against other diseases. For several reasons, we do not consider these results to be reliable: The standard treatment differed greatly: some of the participants received, for example, cortisone-containing drugs that are known to be effective, while others did not.",unknown,"To date, only one study can be found that investigated Artemisia treatment in mild covid-19 progression. However, due to numerous shortcomings, the results are not conclusive. It has not been studied whether Artemisia helps or prevents severe covid 19 disease or whether the plant can prevent coronavirus infection."
5,Can zinc mitigate the progression of Covid-19?,"Thus zinc should not cause Covid-19 sufferers to get better more quickly [3]. However, compared to the other half that did not take zinc, they did not recover faster. So these results suggest that zinc treatment at Covid-19 is not helpful.",no,The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
6,Does zinc preventively protect against covid-19 disease???,A preventive effect has not yet been researched in a single study. It is therefore unclear whether the preventive use of zinc preparations protects against an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or a Covid-19 disease.,unknown,The results of two studies on this suggest that sufferers with Covid-19 do not recover more quickly with zinc than without. A preventive effect has not yet been investigated in studies.
7,Does a cold spray with trypsin protect against colds or covid-19? Does the spray reduce symptoms and duration of illness?,"No previously published study has investigated whether the cold spray can prevent a disease. Thus, it is not certain that the cold spray shortens the duration of a cold. If you look at the number of people who report cold complaints after artificial infection (21 out of 23 in the spray group, 16 out of 23 in the placebo group), there is no clear difference that speaks for a preventive effect of the cold spray. Therefore, we do not consider the results of the study meaningful: With spray, the participants assessed the duration of their cold shorter (7.7 days) than without spray (10.4 days). Interestingly, there was no clear difference between the two groups: The spray group did not reach much less to other colds than the control group.",unknown,The question was investigated in two small studies with gross deficiencies. They cannot prove that treatment with the cold spray relieves symptoms or shortens the duration of illness. Whether the spray has a preventive effect has not been researched for either colds or Covid-19.
8,"Does injecting low-dose Corona vaccine into the skin (mesotherapy vaccination, microvaccination) protect against Covid-19 as well as proven full-dose vaccination into muscle?",Whether the mesotherapy vaccination against the coronavirus protects against a covid-19 disease is not researched. Whether Corona vaccination by mesotherapy provides effective protection against Covid-19 remains unclear.,unknown,"Some doctors offer corona vaccination using the so-called mesotherapeutic method. Here, vaccination is administered into the skin instead of into the upper arm muscle, with a fraction of the tested and approved dose. Such applications have not been explored for the Corona vaccines. Effective protection against Covid-19 is not assured."
9,Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish (Kren) prevent recurrent cystitis?,"In the prevention study, it can be seen that the herbal product and the sham medication did not differ significantly in the case of symptoms such as nausea or allergic reactions [1]. According to this, the capuchin cress-meerrettiche preparation probably does not offer any preventive protection.",no,"As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis. For the treatment of cystitis, we were also only able to evaluate one study. However, it leaves too many questions unanswered to be able to clearly assess its effectiveness."
10,Do herbal remedies with nasturtium and horseradish alleviate the symptoms of cystitis as well as an antibiotic???,"The antibiotic alleviated the discomfort faster than the product with capuchin cress and horseradish, after eight days there was no difference. Therefore, the herbal agent is not likely to be a full substitute for an antibiotic.",unknown,"As for prevention, we have found only one small but somewhat reliable study. According to this, nasturtium-horseradish remedies probably cannot prevent cystitis. For the treatment of cystitis, we were also only able to evaluate one study. However, it leaves too many questions unanswered to be able to clearly assess its effectiveness."
11,Does mistletoe therapy help against cancer or can it improve the quality of life of cancer patients?,"It is currently unclear whether cancer sufferers live longer or better due to mistletoe therapy. No longer survival time detectable The analysis of the previously published survival studies [1] shows that overall mistletoe therapy does not seem to be able to prolong the lifetime of cancer patients. In order to prove this, meaningful studies are still missing â€“ even after about a hundred years.The studies in detail We looked for overviews in three different databases, which summarize the current study situation on mistletoe therapy in cancer.",unknown,"Mistletoe therapy for cancer has been investigated in some studies. However, these are very poor and come to inconsistent results. They cannot prove that mistletoe therapy is effective. In addition, there is a suspicion that mistletoe preparations may even stimulate tumor growth in some types of cancer."
12,Can homeopathic remedies prevent colds in children?,"Benefits for prevention improbable The conclusion of the review work: Homeopathy is probably not an effective means of preventing colds in children. Children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill in the meaningful studies and their colds were not milder. Overall, the studies could not find a preventive effect of homeopathic medicines; they did not reduce the frequency or severity of cold diseases.",no,"Well-conducted studies find neither a preventive nor an alleviating effect of homeopathy on children's colds (chills). However, these studies have examined too few children for a truly conclusive result. Larger studies would be needed for a clear answer.  It is not scientifically plausible that homeopathic remedies are effective."
13,Can homeopathic remedies relieve colds in children??,Children who regularly took homeopathic medicines were not less likely to become ill in the meaningful studies and their colds were not milder. The few well-executed studies clearly showed no effect of homeopathy against colds.,no,"Well-done studies find neither a preventive nor an alleviating effect of homeopathy on children's colds (chills). However, these studies have examined too few children for a truly conclusive result. Larger studies would be needed for a clear answer.  It is not scientifically plausible that homeopathic remedies are effective."
14,Do agents containing uridine and/or cytidine improve the symptoms of polyneuropathy?,"Despite searching in three large databases, we have not been able to find any studies that met these criteria. Whether drugs with uridine and/or cytidine actually help with polyneuropathia, we cannot estimate on this basis.",unknown,We have not been able to find any meaningful studies on this question.
15,Can treatments with ultrasound relieve the pain of osteoarthritis?,"In three studies [3-5], there was no clear benefit from the treatment in the ultrasound group. [2] Many promises, little behind osteoarthritis can greatly affect the quality of life. The summary of the different study results, although purely mathematically, indicated that ultrasound as therapy has no analgesic effect. Therefore, better studies must clarify the potential efficacy of ultrasound therapy against osteoarthritis pain.",unknown,"A number of studies have investigated whether ultrasound can help with osteoarthritis of the knee joints. However, their results are not conclusive; the study results are too contradictory to make a definite statement. For osteoarthritis of the hip or hands, this has not been investigated at all."
16,Does regular exercise reduce the severity and duration of colds and other respiratory infections?,"However, the studies indicate that regular exercise can reduce the duration and severity of respiratory infections. Thus, regular exercise increases life expectancy and reduces, among other things, the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke diabetes cancer depression. The studies suggest that although the number of infections can not be reduced by sport, it may be a little milder for the duration of the disease and for the duration of the disease as a whole.",yes,"Previous studies suggest that sports-playing people may be just as likely to have respiratory infections as sports-muffle people. However, the illnesses are likely to be somewhat less severe and a bit shorter overall."
17,Can regular exercise prevent you from getting a cold or other respiratory infections???,"People who practice sports on a regular basis are likely to suffer as often from respiratory infections as sports muffles. The studies suggest that although the number of infections can not be reduced by sport, it may be a little milder for the duration of the disease and for the duration of the disease as a whole.",no,"Previous studies suggest that sports-playing people may be just as likely to have respiratory infections as sports-muffle people. However, the illnesses are likely to be somewhat less severe and a bit shorter overall."
18,"Can cold showers, cold baths or cold water treading according to Kneipp prevent colds and respiratory infections in adults?","After evaluating the best available studies, we have come to the conclusion that the question is simply not well enough to speak out for or against effectiveness. These studies, too, cannot demonstrate or exclude any effect.",unknown,The three studies conducted to date are too deficient to answer this question.
19,"Can the Wim Hof method - consisting of breathing training, meditation and acclimatization to cold - strengthen the immune system of healthy people and thus prevent infectious diseases?","Cold without proven effect for health For none of these promises there is evidence. The study also cannot answer whether trained people reacted less strongly to the bacterial poison than non-trained people â€“ because they lack accurate data. Even if the study had been carried out better, the extent to which this actually brings health benefits such as a reduced risk of infectious diseases is entirely speculative. Even if it were better methodically, it could not answer whether it is the cold that does anything. The cold records from Wim Hof are partly impressive, but whether cold training has a health benefit can not prove this study.",unknown,"There are individual small studies on the Wim Hof method, but they are poor and inconclusive. Whether the method reduces the probability of infectious diseases has never been researched."
20,Do saw palmetto preparations improve the symptoms of benign enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the longer term compared to placebo?,"No better than placebo The two systematic overviews [1,2] come to the conclusion in the summary in agreement: The saw palm preparations do not relieve prostate problems better than a sham medication. In other studies that tested saw palm as an addition to tamsulosin, the addition of saw palm did not bring any extra benefit.",no,"According to current studies, remedies with saw palmetto do not improve the symptoms of a benign enlarged prostate in the longer term more than a placebo. This assessment is well supported."
21,Does honey help against acute cough in children?,"Probably effective â€“ a little It turned out that honey as an anti-cough remedy is likely to have a certain justification. With honey, the severity of the cough was about 2 points better the next day. Thus, honey can obviously help children with acute cough a little by reducing discomfort and shortening their duration. The shortening of the cough duration was also noticeable, but not spectacular: it was reduced from a good 5 days (with placebo) to about four and a half days (with honey). Thus, honey is likely to have a positive effect both on the duration of coughing and on the symptoms associated with coughing, albeit on a modest scale.",yes,"Honey should help children with acute cough: The coughing attacks are likely to become somewhat less frequent, weaker and less distressing. Children's and parents' sleep may also improve, and the time to resolution is likely to be a little shorter. However, the effects achieved are only small."
22,Can Artemisia tea cure malaria as well as drugs?,"And even if there were no problems with resistance â€“ it is questionable whether Artemisia remedies from non-professional self-cultivation could reliably compete with the standardized quality of artemisinin drugs. Based on the studies available to us, we can neither clearly demonstrate nor completely exclude the benefit of Artemisia tea for sustainable malaria treatment with low relapse probability.",unknown,"Four studies with a total of relatively few participants come to contradictory results. Since all studies have problems, we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions about the healing success - i.e., we can neither confirm nor exclude a positive lasting effect."
23,Does thyme help against cough?,"We couldn't find a single clinical trial that investigated exclusively thyme for an effect against cough. Conjectures without evidence Although it is not proven that ingredients of the thyme can actually relieve cough, it is also not refuted. However, there is no scientific evidence to date that the mucus solution itself has a relieving or shortening effect on cough [7,8]. Therefore, it cannot be said directly whether thyme alone can relieve cough.",unknown,Whether thyme is effective against cough has not yet been researched in meaningful studies.
24,Does coenzyme Q10 relieve muscle discomfort during treatment with statins?,"In seven studies, the coenzyme Q10 group was no better than the placebo group. When the research team removed this study from the overall evaluation, the remaining studies came together to a relatively similar result: Coenzyme Q10 does not help better than a sham medication.",unknown,"Several studies come to contradictory results. In addition, the range of variation in the estimated effect is very large, and the individual studies have certain shortcomings. On this basis, no firm conclusions can be drawn."
25,Does Chaga mushroom help against cancer or other diseases?,Such study results cannot say anything concrete about the effect in the human body. It is therefore impossible to answer whether the chaga mushroom can cure or prevent diseases.,unknown,The effect of Chaga mushrooms has not yet been investigated in studies with humans.
26,"Can filtering out blue light using blue filter glasses or night mode settings on smartphone, tablet or laptop screens have a beneficial effect on sleep?","With activated blue filter night mode or blue filter glasses, the participants took a similar amount of time to fall asleep as without blue filter. Perhaps the amount of blue light on tablets, smartphones, ebook readers or laptop screens is not enough to disturb the body's own melatonin production. The overall study situation now indicates that blue light from screen devices has no influence on sleep.",no,"In previous studies, it makes no noticeable difference to sleep when the blue light component of display screen devices is filtered out in the evening. However, the results are not well validated because the studies are of low quality and usually only examined a few people."
27,Is strophanthin an effective cardiovascular drug?,"Furthermore, the positive results of strophanthin are not credible according to studies. Whether strophanthin relieves symptoms of coronary heart disease or heart failure better than today's standard medications, can therefore not be derived from these studies. Whether strophanthine has a benefit in this respect, the two found studies do not answer.",unknown,"We found two small flawed studies. They only investigated whether complaints improve in the short term, but not the long-term effect on disease progression and deaths. Since the studies are quite old, it is also not possible to assess how strophanthin compares with modern, well-studied drugs."
28,Can regular intake of vitamin C prevent colds?,"Although those who swallow vitamin C preventatively are probably a little shorter ill in case of a cold, the effect seems small: With an average duration of seven days of disease, vitamin C would reduce to six to six and a half days of disease. A clear advantage was not shown â€“ the number of participants who had been cold was hardly lower with vitamin C than with placebo.",no,"Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds. However, it can reduce the average duration of illness by half a day to a day from a week. Vitamin C is unlikely to improve a cold that has already occurred."
29,Can taking vitamin C after the onset of a cold relieve symptoms or shorten the illness?,Symptom treatment probably without effect The recommendation to take high-dose vitamin C at the first signs of a cold cannot be confirmed by studies. The combined results of previous studies do not show that vitamin C can relieve cold symptoms.,no,"Preventive intake of high-dose vitamin C for a long time does not prevent the occurrence of colds. However, it can reduce the average duration of illness by half a day to a day from a week. Vitamin C is unlikely to improve a cold that has already occurred."
30,Do saline nasal rinses and nasal sprays or inhaling with steam from saline solution help with colds?,"It is still unclear whether they have a positive effect on colds. Whether salt water â€“ whether as a rinsing, inhalation or spray â€“ can relieve the discomfort of colds or shorten the disease remains unclear. So whether salt water helps the nose with colds, we can't say.",unknown,Whether nasal rinses or nasal sprays with salt water help with colds (chills) with a blocked or runny nose cannot be answered by the studies conducted to date. This is because they come to contradictory results and are not very conclusive. Whether inhaling with steam from hot salt water helps with colds has not yet been researched.
31,Do remedies with ginseng help with erectile dysfunction?,"No significant effect The current study suggests that no significant improvement can be expected. According to studies, erection ability and satisfaction with sexual intercourse did not increase significantly on average.",no,"Previous studies suggest that dietary supplements with ginseng tend not to bring a significant change. This means that neither erectile function nor sexual satisfaction are likely to improve. At the very least, however, side effects are not likely to occur in large numbers. All assessments are not well substantiated."
32,Can taking spermidine prolong life? Can it prevent diseases?,"Whether spermidine absorbed by food or as a capsule has a life-extending effect in humans, such attempts cannot answer â€“ man differs too much from worms and flies. Spermidine from capsules: unexplored However, we have found no studies at all on the life-prolonging effect of spermidine as a dietary supplement.",unknown,"No study has yet investigated whether spermidine in the form of dietary supplements helps people live longer or healthier. There are two observational studies on the influence of a spermidine-rich diet on life expectancy. However, their results are not conclusive."
33,Can capsules or tablets with lactase improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make dairy products more tolerable?,"The magnitude of the effect of lactase and the noticeable improvement of symptoms cannot be derived from all studies. Fewer symptoms with lactase In five studies, the participants from the lactase group reported a total of fewer complaints [2-4.6.7]. In only one study [4], the participants reported a marked improvement after taking lactase â€“ their symptoms were only half as severe. Lactase tablets and capsules may make dairy products at least slightly more compatible with lactose intolerance.",yes,"Tablets and capsules containing the enzyme lactase may alleviate the symptoms of lactose intolerance. It is unclear whether those affected feel the effect clearly. Our assessment is not well substantiated. The studies published to date are very small and, for the most part, poorly conducted."
34,Can weighted blankets help with sleep disorders?,"No evidence of efficacy The result of our research is sobering: We could not find clear indications of a sleep-enhancing effect. Movement measurements of the participants showed that they did not sleep calmer or longer with a weight cover. These results suggest that weight covers do not help with sleep disorders. A positive effect of weight covers on the disturbed sleep is therefore questionable â€“ but we cannot exclude them either. This means: Whether with a heavy or a light blanket â€“ on average there was no difference in total sleep time, time to fall asleep and waking up after the first sleep.",unknown,"Studies to date find no convincing evidence of effective help for sleep disorders - at least in autistic children and adults with mental illness. However, a benefit cannot be ruled out either. More research is needed."
35,Does the drug remdesivir prevent COVID-19 deaths?,"The results are sobering: Remdesivir treatment probably does not prevent deaths from Covid-19 [1,2]. However, Remdesivir is unlikely to be a significant aid in the treatment of Covid-19. Not when it comes to the risk of dying: after two to four weeks Remdesivir had died about the same number of people as without Remdesivir. In the studies, an average of 10 to 11 out of 100 patients died within one month, whether they had received Remdesivir, an ineffective dummy medication (placebo) or the usual medical care [1,2]. Remdesivir therefore does not seem to prevent deaths.",no,"For some time, great hope was placed in Remdesivir in the fight against the pandemic. According to the studies conducted so far, however, the drug cannot prevent deaths from Covid-19. It is of little help that the disease seems to worsen somewhat more slowly with Remdesivir."
36,Does magnetic resonance therapy improve complaints of knee osteoarthritis or herniated discs (e.g. pain)?,"Their results, however, raise doubts about the effect of nuclear resonance therapy against pain and other complaints. None of the studies showed a pain-relieving effect. Twelve weeks later, according to the team of authors, there were no differences in pain, daily limitations and quality of life between the treatment group and the control group.",no,"Previous studies of MBST nuclear magnetic resonance therapy have shown no difference from sham treatment - suggesting that the treatment does not help. However, this judgment cannot be well supported due to the lack of power of the studies."
37,Are oral zinc supplements effective for treating a cold (chill)?,"But according to the current state of knowledge, zinc preparations may help adults [1] to recover a little faster. According to previous studies [1], adults taking zinc could reduce the duration of their cold by around one and a half days. According to the summarized study results, the intake of zinc supplements in adults could reduce the duration of the disease by 1.8 days. Consequently, it may be worth taking zinc supplements for adults if they want to significantly reduce the duration of the disease.",yes,"It is possible that oral zinc supplements may slightly shorten the duration of a cold in adults. However, many details concerning efficacy and safety are still unclear. Studies to date cannot answer the question of whether zinc also has a preventive effect - they are not conclusive enough."
38,Do oral zinc supplements prevent a cold???,We have found that preparations with zinc for oral use â€“ such as lozenges â€“ do not cast away the annoying colds.,unknown,"It is possible that oral zinc supplements may slightly shorten the duration of a cold in adults. However, many details concerning efficacy and safety are still unclear. Studies to date cannot answer the question of whether zinc also has a preventive effect - they are not conclusive enough."
39,Is colloidal gold good for health?,"Apparently, humans have never been investigated whether or which preventive and healing effects could have drinkable gold nanoparticles. The Vienna Environmental Attorney's Office also came to this conclusion: it warned against solutions with silver and gold nanoparticles, as too little is known about their possible harmfulness [5]. Gold against rheumatism A judgment on colloidal gold is therefore not possible due to lack of scientific evidence. Further information We have already reported on the potential benefits and dangers of nanosilver in another article.The studies in detail There are no well-made studies that have investigated the effectiveness of colloidal gold.",unknown,"Statements about a possible health benefit of ""drinkable nano gold"" are not possible, because there are no good studies about it. Gold in other forms can help with rheumatism and other diseases, but side effects often occur."
40,Do probiotics alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome?,"Thus, probiotics as a whole could possibly help with irritable bowels. With probiotics there was relief in just under half, with placebo in only one third. Although the probiotics usually cut off better than the sham medication, the effect was very small.",yes,"Three summaries of the best available studies consistently found a small effect. However, it is unclear whether the computationally ""visible"" effect is actually noticeable for people with irritable bowel syndrome. There is also evidence that not all studies have been published."
41,Do you get a stomach ache if you eat cherries or other stone fruit and then drink water?,"Research does not seem to be particularly concerned about the potential risk of this food combination. In any case, we could not find a single study on the subject in our elaborate research. In short, there are no scientific studies that show that drinking water after eating cherries causes discomfort. But this explanation does not seem particularly plausible for the cherries-water myth: On the one hand, the ""problem of short-term gastric acid dilution not only arises with water [6].",unknown,We found no scientific studies or documented case reports showing that drinking water after eating cherries causes discomfort.
42,Can acoustic CR Â® neuromodulation according to Tass help with tinnitus?,"Whether the acoustic CR neuromodulation has a positive effect in tinnitus is therefore scientifically unproven (but also not excluded). After both neuromodulation and sham treatment, the participants felt that tinnitus was quieter and less burdensome. Neuromodulation did not appear to be clearly effective.",unknown,"The only two potentially meaningful studies cannot answer the question. This is because they are small and have serious flaws. A large study intended to show the effectiveness of ""acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation"" for tinnitus produced inconclusive results - and was never published. Whether the therapy can help with tinnitus thus remains questionable."
43,Is ivermectin an effective drug for treating covid 19 disease?,"According to previous studies, probably wrong: Ivermectin may not have a noticeable effect on a Covid-19 disease: it does not seem to alleviate the disease's symptoms. Both the European Supervisory Authority EMA (European Medical Agency) and the World Health Organization WHO currently advise against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19 (as of July 2021) [6,7]. There was no difference between the ivermectin and placebo groups â€“ therefore, ivermectin does not seem to help to mitigate the symptoms typical of Covid-19.",no,"Studies to date suggest that ivermectin does not mitigate covid-19. There is also no evidence that the drug can prevent deaths from covid-19. However, a possible beneficial effect cannot be ruled out with certainty either. Larger studies would be needed for this."
44,Does ivermectin lower the risk of death in covid-19?,"According to you, there is no evidence that ivermectin can prevent deaths. However, since there were only 35 deaths in all studies taken together, no reliable conclusions can be drawn for the event outside the studies.",unknown,"Studies to date suggest that ivermectin does not mitigate covid-19. There is also no evidence that the drug can prevent deaths from covid-19. However, a possible beneficial effect cannot be ruled out with certainty either. Larger studies would be needed for this."
45,Can green tea protect against coronavirus infection or help treat covid-19?,"Thus, it cannot be proven (or ruled out) that green tea protects against Corona infection or can relieve covid-19 disease. Whether the green tea substances concentrate sufficiently in those body cells that are infected by the corona virus is also unclear. We have described what we know about the effectiveness of Gurgel solutions against SARS-CoV-2 in our own article.The studies in detail We have not found any studies that have investigated the effects of green tea on patients with Covid-19.",unknown,"So far, this has not been verified in studies with humans. Such an effect is therefore unclear."
46,Does vitamin D alleviate autism symptoms in children?,"But we could not find any evidence of positive effects on autism. Medicines for the treatment of autism-typical symptoms do not exist [9].The studies in detail We wanted to know whether vitamin D can alleviate the most important symptoms of autism: Are there any improvements in social and communication behaviour? The combined results [1] of the two studies [10.11] do not indicate that vitamin D can improve communication or rigid, repetitive behavioural patterns, whether alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acids. Overall, the results of the four studies do not give a solid indication that vitamin D helps children with autism. Since only a few children have participated, the results are hardly comparable and partly contradict each other, the significance of the previous studies is small â€“ that is, we can neither prove nor exclude a positive effect.",unknown,"Studies on the subject are sparse and inconclusive. Even if individual studies claim to have observed positive effects, their results are unclear and contradictory. A strong improvement of autism symptoms was not shown in any of the previous studies."
47,Does glutathione improve the tolerability of chemotherapy for cancer?,"Therefore, we cannot make statements about glutathione as a dietary supplement for swallowing, the effect of glutathione in other chemotherapys (without platinum) or in relation to other side effects. Therefore, our conclusion: We cannot confirm or exclude that glutathione infusions mitigate or prevent nerve damage as a side effect of platinum-containing chemotherapy. Thus, no conclusions can be drawn about the potential later use of glutathione.",unknown,"Eight studies have examined whether glutathione can mitigate or prevent nerve damage during platinum-containing chemotherapy. But unfortunately, they do not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn: The studies were rather small, used different measurement tools, and came to contradictory results."
48,Does carnosine relieve autism symptoms in children?,"We have found four studies [1-4] that all come to the same conclusion: They indicate that carnosine is ineffective [5]. Summary results with limited expressiveness No improvement (or deterioration) of symptoms was seen in any of the studies â€“ neither in social interaction, communication, nor in rigid, repeated behaviors. A summary analysis of the study results [5] also indicated no improvement.",no,"Previous studies suggest a lack of efficacy. However, the small number of participants and shortcomings in the study design reduce the significance of the results."
49,Can echinacea protect against Sars-CoV-2 infection or help treat covid-19?,"Even if Echinacea could help against a number of cold viruses, this would not yet prove that it also helps with Covid-19. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) therefore advises from an application up to the age of 12 years and in pregnant women from [3].The studies in detail Despite extensive research in the research databases Pubmed, Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos, we could not find clinical studies with human participants in which the effectiveness of Echinacea was investigated to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",unknown,There are no clinical studies on the prevention of Covid-19. The only study on the treatment of Covid-19 does not allow an assessment due to numerous shortcomings.
50,"Does amygdalin, the toxin from the seeds of apricots and other stone fruits, help against cancer?","Unscientific myth In fact, there is no evidence of a cancer healing or preventive effect. We do not know any meaningful study in which the anti-cancer effect of apricots or the amygdalin contained therein has been investigated [1]. So there is no evidence of an effect against cancer.",unknown,"It is a myth that eating bitter apricot seeds can cure or prevent cancer. Instead, it has been proven that the amygdalin contained in them is toxic. Eating bitter apricot seeds can cause severe poisoning, sometimes fatal."
51,Can ginkgo extract relieve the symptoms of tinnitus?,All three studies came to the same conclusion: Ginkgo extract cannot relieve tinnitus better than placebo (a dummy medicine). So Ginkgo doesn't help with tinnitus better than a placebo â€“ but it probably doesn't hurt either.,no,"Preparations with ginkgo extract cannot help with tinnitus. They do not reduce the volume of the ringing in the ears any more than a placebo. This is the result of a summary of the most significant studies, which all came to the same conclusion."
52,Do remedies with ginkgo help against tinnitus in people with dementia?,"We can therefore neither affirm nor exclude that drugs containing ginkgo extract have a positive influence on the tinnitus of dementia sufferers. Missing information When reading the individual studies [1-4], it remains unclear how many of the dementia patients studied had tinnitus at all â€“ and how the symptoms of this particular subgroup of subjects have changed in the course of the study. In the individual studies [1-4], there is also a lack of information as to whether the tinnitus patients from the ginkgo and placebo groups were similar enough for a fair comparison.",unknown,"The efficacy of ginkgo against tinnitus in dementia patients has been co-tested in a few studies. Some of these studies are not well understood. Based on the results published so far, we cannot make a clear assessment of efficacy - i.e. neither confirm nor exclude that ginkgo helps in this case."
53,Does garlic protect against corona infections?,"Not studied: Anti-Corona effect We have therefore been looking for meaningful studies. However, we have not found any such study to protect us from Corona.",unknown,"We could not find a single meaningful study on the protective effect of garlic against Corona infections. There is no scientific basis for such claims. On the question of whether garlic protects against colds, we were able to evaluate only one study. However, this is relatively small and has gross weaknesses. The supposedly positive result is therefore not reliable."

55,Do dietary supplements with magnesium and/or zinc improve symptoms in children with ADHD?,"Studies on Magnesium For the benefit of magnesium in ADHD, we have not found a randomized controlled study. In addition, there are further shortcomings, which is why the studies are not meaningful: In one study [1] all children received treatment with certain psychopharmaceuticals, which no longer corresponds to the current state of science. The results of the studies are contradictory: two studies [5.6] suggested a positive effect of zinc. In three other studies [3, 4, 7] there were no differences between the zinc and control groups.",unknown,"For magnesium, we did not find any meaningful studies. For zinc, we were able to identify several studies that appear interesting at first glance. However, the studies are deficient, contradictory and possibly not transferable to the situation in Europe. Therefore, we cannot derive any definite statements."
56,"Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae relieve discomfort from a cold (""chill"")?","Relieving little likely And what if you are already ill and the cooling is full of ""blooming up""? However, it is doubtful that this effect is so great that it makes a noticeable difference for people with a cold. That cold sprays with red algae carragees actually have a great benefit in colds is therefore not likely.",no,Such a nasal spray is unlikely to significantly alleviate cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold. Whether the spray can in principle protect against a cold has not yet been researched.
57,Does a nasal spray with carrageenan from red algae prevent colds?,"Preventive effect unclear As far as the theory is concerned. Avoiding contagion Overall, the possibilities for preventing a cold are limited. Because in most cases, the worst is over after a week.The studies in detail To prevent colds, we could not find any studies in our research.",unknown,Such a nasal spray is unlikely to significantly alleviate cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold. Whether the spray can in principle protect against a cold has not yet been researched.
58,"Can the ""Miracle Mineral Supplement"" MMS (sodium chlorite) cure diseases or alleviate ailments?","No meaningful studies on MMS There is no evidence that MMS can cure diseases or relieve discomfort. However, there is not the slightest indication that MMS could help against cancer or any other disease such as an infection with coronaviruses. However, this study is so poor that its published results are not meaningful. We doubt, for many reasons, that the reported results can be translated into ""real life"": it is questionable whether the two groups were comparable at the beginning of the study â€“ for example, whether they were equally seriously ill or had an equally high risk of a serious disease.",unknown,"Experts around the world warn against the use of MMS. In several cases, the agent has caused severe poisoning. Claims about a healing effect are untenable rumors. There is no evidence that the substance is effective against autism, malaria, cancer, AIDS or hepatitis, or that it helps with an infection with the coronavirus (Covid-19)."

60,"Does colloidal silver (""silver water"") work against infection with the coronavirus or other pathogens? Does it have any other health benefits?","Whether drinking colloidal silver can do something about pathogens such as coronavirus has never been seriously investigated. However, it cannot be concluded that colloidal silver also acts against pathogens in the human body. And even if: Whether the silver concentration there would be sufficiently high to kill pathogens on the one hand and at the same time not cause serious side effects is also questionable.",unknown,"Whether colloidal silver can cure infections with the coronavirus and other diseases or has a preventive effect has never been investigated in meaningful studies. Claims about the effectiveness of silver water are therefore made up out of thin air. What is certain, however, is that colloidal silver can discolor the skin blue-gray when the metal particle solution is drunk."
61,Is whole-body vibration therapy effective in preventing bone fractures in osteoporosis sufferers?,"However, we could not find a single study in which researchers evaluated whether osteoporosis suffers from rare (or frequent) bone fractures with vibration training. Read more about osteoporosis on the pages of Gesundheitsinformation.de [4].The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether vibration training is effective to reduce the risk of bone fractures in people with osteoporosis. The review therefore does not allow any direct conclusions on the risk of bone fracture in osteoporosis.",unknown,"We did not find any studies that investigated whether vibration training affects the risk of bone fractures in people with osteoporosis.

We couldn't find any completed studies on this.,unknown,"Antimicrobial mouthwashes can reduce the amount of corona viruses in the mouth and throat. However, it is not certain that this will result in a faster resolution of the symptoms of covid 19 disease. There are no studies on this yet. The same applies to the preventive effect of regular gargling with mouth rinses. Theoretically, however, there are many arguments against efficacy."
63,Can inhalation with budesonide spray relieve symptoms of covid-19?,The cortisone preparation Budesonide can alleviate the symptoms of a Covid-19 disease and significantly reduce hospital intakes â€“ according to a recently published study from Oxford [1]. No difference in hospital stays In the larger study [2] the participants of the Budesonide group also reported slightly less severe complaints than the comparison group without Budesonide. The study results currently available indicate a potential positive effect of budesonide in Covid-19.,yes,"In mild covid-19 disease, the cortisone preparation budesonide may be able to alleviate symptoms somewhat and make patients feel better more quickly. However, these results are not well established. The study results available to date cannot reliably answer the question of whether patients with budesonide also need to be hospitalized less often. It is also unclear whether budesonide can also help severely ill patients or prevent deaths caused by Covid-19."

66,"Does the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" improve blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes or does it prevent secondary diseases?","Disappointing result Our research in three scientific literature databases was quite fast in the sand for the preparation ""BestProvita Diabetin: We did not find a single study that would have tested a food supplement with this composition. So whether the capsules have the promised effect cannot be assessed.",unknown,"Neither for the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" nor for the particularly touted ingredient blueberry could we find meaningful studies."
67,Do blueberries improve blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes or do they prevent secondary diseases?,"No ""blue miracle"" Similarly disappointing ended our search for the benefit of blueberries in type 2 diabetes: The scientific literature cited by the provider on his website is not particularly meaningful for the alleged benefit. We could not find a single meaningful study on blueberry in type 2 diabetes. Whether blueberries in type 2 diabetes actually improve metabolism or protect against consequential damage, we cannot therefore assess. This also applies to studies on blueberry â€“ we could not discover well-made studies on a positive effect for diabetics.",unknown,"Neither for the product ""BestProvita Diabetin"" nor for the particularly touted ingredient blueberry could we find meaningful studies."
68,Do self-performed nasal drill tests in symptom-free individuals detect coronavirus infection as reliably as professionally performed rapid tests using swabs from the nasopharynx?,"The rather sobering result of the only study that we could find: 10 complaints-free, infected persons do the nose drill test, then this should overlook the infection in 6 to 9 cases [1]. About three quarters of the symptomless infections are likely to remain unrecognized. The swab from the nasal throat with subsequent evaluation by the PCR is currently the most reliable method to detect Coronavirus infection [3].The studies in detail Nose drilling instead of professional fast tests?",unknown,"The nasal drill test is said to be less complicated and less unpleasant than the rapid test with a deep swab from the nasopharynx. However, it is unclear whether both test methods provide similarly reliable results. To date, there has been no direct comparison of self-performed nasal drill testing and rapid nasopharyngeal testing by trained personnel.  Comparisons with the PCR test, currently the most reliable coronavirus detection method, however, show: In people without covid-19 symptoms, the nasal pick test is rather unreliable. About three quarters of infections could be missed."
69,Are rapid antigen tests as reliable as slower PCR tests? Does a negative (inconspicuous) rapid test result reliably exclude an infection with the coronavirus?,"A negative test result is also only a snapshot: Even if the antigen test is inconspicuous, you can already have infected yourself, and the test might be positive the following day. Rapid tests do not allow the corona virus to be detected in as small quantities as PCR tests. PCR tests are also not infallible, but they are currently considered the most reliable method of detecting infection with SARS-CoV-2.",no,"Rapid antigen tests are more flexible and faster than PCR tests. However, the reliability of rapid antigen tests depends heavily on the timing of the test: the tests are most reliable when the first symptoms appear. Rapid antigen tests do not come close to the reliability of longer PCR tests."
70,Does CBD help with sleep disorders?,"The impact of CBD on sleep has not yet been seriously investigated [7]. They have not investigated whether CBD regularly ingested over a long period of time helps with sleep disorders. Whether the participants fell asleep with CBD earlier and their sleep was deeper, the research team did not measure intelligibly. Differences in sleep effects between CBD and dummy preparation could not be discovered by the research group in its study.",unknown,We could not find any meaningful studies on this question.
71,Are heavy (ex-)smokers less likely to die of lung cancer if they regularly participate in lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT)?,"Probably a little less deaths due to lung cancer The benefits and damage of a systematic screening of lung cancer by computer tomography (short: CT) for current or former strong smokers is documented in two current systematic overviews [1,2]. Without screening, 28 out of 1000 participants died of lung cancer With screening, 23 out of 1000 participants died of lung cancer 5 out of 1000 participants were spared a death from lung cancer by screening. This means that we know with quite high certainty that the screenings (some few) of lung cancer deaths in the risk group prevent. In addition, early lung cancer detection sometimes also detects early forms of cancer that would never have caused problems during their lifetime.",yes,"Screening in the high-risk group probably prevents deaths from lung cancer. Whether the screened individuals actually live longer and have a higher quality of life is not clear. There are also risks: On the one hand, some screened individuals receive a diagnosis of lung cancer but would not have experienced symptoms during their lifetime. Furthermore, a small proportion of screened individuals must expect a false-positive result (""false alarm""). Until the all-clear is given, interventions are necessary for clarification, during which complications can occur."
72,Can lung cancer screening by computed tomography (CT) also do harm???,"So Salopp's wording is unclear whether people with screening are less likely to die of lung cancer, but they may be ill in the rest of their lives, for example through stressful treatments. Also consider disadvantages The probable, but rather small use of the screening is opposed to some disadvantages: False alarms are likely to occur among 1 to 15 out of 1000 participants in the screening group. Up to 22 out of 1000 screened people are expected to be diagnosed with ""overdiagnoses"" â€“ lung cancer, which would not have been detected without screening, because it does not cause any symptoms throughout the life. Another reason not to screen further: if another disease occurs, which probably significantly shortens the lifespan or leads to the patient being unable to operate on the lungs for cancer treatment [6].",yes,"Screening in the high-risk group likely prevents deaths from lung cancer. Whether the screened individuals actually live longer and have a higher quality of life is not clear. There are also risks: On the one hand, some screened individuals receive a diagnosis of lung cancer but would not have experienced symptoms during their lifetime.

73,Does hydroxychloroquine reduce the likelihood of dying from covid-19 disease?,"On the contrary, the study results leave open the possibility that hydroxychloroquine even slightly increases the risk of death. For prevention and treatment useless Both analyses [1,2] come to the sobering result: The fact that hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk of death by Covid-19 is almost impossible. The same conclusion was also made by a comprehensive review of Cochrane Collaboration [4]: The nine randomized controlled studies included in it also show no effect of hydroxychloroquine on the risk of dying of Covid-19.",no,"The results of all studies to date preclude hydroxychloroquine from preventing deaths in covid-19 patients. The drug also does not appear to attenuate the disease. A preventive effect is also unlikely, according to the study results. It is well documented that hydroxychloroquine has side effects. Among other things, the drug can damage the heart and kidneys."
74,Does hydroxychloroquine prevent covid-19 infection???,"And they are as clear as disappointing: therefore hydroxychloroquine can do nothing against the corona virus. Not suitable for prevention Even a preventive effect does not indicate anything: In studies with healthy individuals, the number of participants who regularly take hydroxychloroquine as well as those without medication [2] was similar. The preventive use of hydroxychloroquine could not protect the subjects from a Covid-19 disease.",no,"The results of all studies to date preclude hydroxychloroquine from preventing deaths in covid-19 patients.

75,Do preparations containing rockrose have a preventive or soothing effect on colds (chills) and other upper respiratory tract infections? Can they protect against infections with the coronavirus?,"We did not find any studies on the preventive effect of cistrose preparations. This lacks the scientific basis for the manufacturer's claim that cistrose lollipops would protect against colds or even coronas. For this purpose, participants with cold, throat ache or cough sucked several times a day either pastilles with a cistrose extract or pastilles without active substance (placebo). Nor could we find any studies to prevent colds.",unknown,"Whether tea, lozenges, or other remedies containing cistus protect against colds has never been studied in humans. There are also no such studies on the preventive effect of cistus against corona.  Whether cistus preparations relieve the symptoms of colds (with colds, sore throats, coughs) or even covid-19 has not been clarified. We did find one study that investigated cistus lozenges for various mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections caused by viruses and bacteria. However, this study has serious flaws and does not provide definite answers about efficacy for colds."
76,"Can Medistus Antivirus Lozenges protect against colds, flu, covid-19, or other respiratory infections?","However, we could not find any scientific evidence of the claimed protective effect. So it remains unclear for us whether Medistus Antivirus can actually protect against viruses and other pathogens. However, we find transparent information important â€“ for example for allergy sufferers.The studies in detail In our extensive search in three scientific databases, we did not find any studies on the efficacy of the product Medistus Antivirus or the alleged active substance ""Kistosyn 200"" contained in it.",unknown,"There are no published studies that have verified the effectiveness of the lozenges. The manufacturers also do not reveal what is behind the alleged active ingredient ""Kistosyn 200"". We are therefore unable to judge whether an effect is plausible."
77,Does Spirulina help with obesity?,Without foundation is also the claim that Spirulina can increase heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. That Spirulina can help with diabetes is another myth. For none of Spirulina's health claims there are meaningful studies that can demonstrate an effect. Whether Spirulina can help with weight loss can therefore neither be proved nor refuted.,unknown,"According to various studies, spirulina is supposed to help with asthma, allergies, diabetes or even chronic pain, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or help with weight loss. However, due to serious flaws, the results of these studies are not trustworthy."

79,Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) help against coronavirus or others in throat infections?,"We could not find studies on gurgling with hydrogen peroxide to prevent or treat infections in the throat room. However, it is not plausible that gurgling with hydrogen peroxide can protect against infections with the corona virus. Equally unexplored and questionable is whether hydrogen peroxide is suitable for the treatment of coronavirus infection. It is also one of the natural defense mechanisms with which the body fights against bacteria and viruses [2].The studies in detail In spite of intensive research, we received no answers to the question whether hydrogen peroxide as a Gurgel solution can prevent or combat infections in the throat area.",unknown,"Whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a gargle solution is suitable to treat or prevent COVID-19, sore throats or colds has never been scientifically studied. Neither has whether regular use is harmful. However, if hydrogen peroxide is swallowed or inhaled, there may be health consequences."
80,Does gargling with hydrogen peroxide have health risks?,This means that we cannot say whether hydrogen peroxide gurgles can prevent or alleviate diseases and what long-term side effects there may be. The undesirable consequences of long-term daily gurgling with hydrogen peroxide for the oral mucosa have never been scientifically investigated. Significant studies on potential risks or long-term damage caused by regular rinsing and gurgling with hydrogen peroxide are also missing.,unknown,"Whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a gargle solution is suitable to treat or prevent COVID-19, sore throats or colds has never been scientifically studied. Neither has whether regular use is harmful. However, if hydrogen peroxide is swallowed or inhaled, there may be health consequences."
81,Can vitamin C prevent infection with coronavirus or prevent deaths from covid-19?,The comparison of the two groups does not indicate that vitamin C can prevent deaths from Covid-19. It is therefore unexplored whether vitamin C can reduce the risk of coronavirus infection.,unknown,Studies to date are inconclusive. There is no evidence that high-dose vitamin C infusions reduce the risk of dying from covid-19. A preventive effect has not been researched at all.
82,Does vitamin D prevent covid-19 disease? Does vitamin D mitigate the course of Covid 19 disease?,"But they can't give answers â€“ for example, if the person with vitamin D is better after four weeks than without extra vitamin D. It is also unclear whether the treatment can prevent deaths. Whether the intake of vitamin D reduces the risk of disease in these people cannot be answered by the observational studies. But in vain, no preventive studies on vitamin D and corona appear to have been published.",unknown,Studies to date on the treatment of covid-19 cannot answer whether vitamin D can alleviate the disease. No studies have yet been published on a possible preventive effect.
83,Is plasma therapy for covid-19 effective in preventing deaths?,"For all individuals combined â€“ from slightly affected to life-threatening â€“ no clear benefit has been seen from plasma therapy. The summary of five studies [2-4,6,7] also makes it impossible to estimate how compatible plasma therapy is for covid-19 patients. But the observed positive effect can be due to chance, and once again no reliable statement can be derived: neither that the plasma therapy at Covid-19 is safe nor that it carries a comparatively high risk.",unknown,"The summary of studies to date leaves a range of possibilities open. Overall, the data from mildly to fatally ill patients do not demonstrate either a positive effect or negative effects. Serious side effects have not been sufficiently researched and cannot be ruled out."
84,Does treatment with cortisone-like drugs such as dexamethasone ensure that more critically ill patients survive Covid 19 disease?,"They have found out that the remedies actually have a benefit â€“ even if not for all patients. Only in case of severe progression In case of a serious or even life-threatening course of disease, treatment with cortisone-like medications can reduce mortality in addition to the usual (intensive) measures. With additional cortisone treatment 328 out of 1000 people die with the usual treatment 415 out of 1000 people Cortisone treatment thus saves about 87 out of 1000 people with critical Covid19 disease. In case of severe covid-19 disease, 267 out of 1000 people die with additional cortisone treatment with the usual treatment 334 out of 1000 people Cortisone treatment thus saves about 67 out of 1000 people with severe covid-19 disease.",yes,"In severe or even life-threatening covid-19 disease, cortisone-like medications can save lives. In non-severe covid-19 disease, this has not been proven. Here, there is even evidence that mortality may be higher."
85,Can contact with holy water make you sick?,"It is unclear, however, whether the type and quantity of germs in it is a health risk at all for believers. How the usual contact with holy water can make you ill is virtually unexplored. However, laboratory analyses cannot answer how much contact with the water is necessary to get sick.",unknown,"Pathogens often live in holy water basins. However, whether the usual contact with holy water can actually make people ill has not been researched."
86,Can Echinacea protect against colds?,"People who swallowed echinacea preparations were slightly less likely to catch a cold in studies. The protective effect of Echinacea is probably rather low and would look like this: If 100 people take an active-free dummy preparation, around 54 get a cold. A little less colds from Echinacea According to the summarized results of all studies, a little less people in the Echinacea group became ill than in the group that received the dummy medication. The regular intake of Echinacea products could thus possibly prevent the occurrence of a cold. According to the study, they were less ill if they also took echinacea.",yes,"Regular intake of echinacea extracts could possibly offer some protection against colds. However, the effect seems to be small. It is unclear whether the plant is also suitable for treatment. Study results on this are contradictory."
87,Can echinacea relieve the discomfort of colds???,"No clues to help with colds Unfortunately, the available studies cannot answer whether preparations with Echinacea help if the cold is already there. Effect in case of illness remains unclear Whether Echinacea also helps if the cold is already there, remains unclear despite studies.",unknown,"Regular intake of echinacea extracts could possibly offer some protection against colds.

90,Can light therapy with light lamps relieve the symptoms of autumn-winter depression?,"Overall, these results show that treatment with light bulbs could help some people affected by fall-winter depression at least in the short term. After two to eight weeks of long treatment, the symptoms improved in 25 out of 100 people without light therapy.Light therapy improved in 46 out of 100 people Overall, light therapy helped 21 out of 100 people. Thus, the best available studies suggest that light therapy can help some people.",yes,"Light therapy with light lamps may be able to relieve fall-winter depression. However, it seems to help only one in five affected people. It is unclear how long an improvement lasts. Long-term studies are lacking."
91,Does vitamin B3 protect against severe covid-19 events?,"Why such studies from the perspective of some experts seem promising at all, however, does not make us quite clear: because the reasons for the planned studies cite almost exclusively possible mechanisms of action at cell level, not even animal experiments with vitamin B3. Whether vitamin B3 helps to prevent severe Covid-19 processes remains to be seen. This vitamin deficiency disease can alter the skin and mucous membranes, but can also cause neurological disorders [3].The studies in detail For the benefit of vitamin B3 in Covid-19, we have not found completed meaningful studies. Based on these very preliminary (and usually not used by us) sources, we believe that we can identify potential weaknesses of the study: In this way, two treatments with unknown effects are tested and compared within the study: We do not know whether they help from vitamin B3 or from silica.",unknown,We could not find any completed meaningful studies on this topic. Two ongoing studies are currently investigating the question.
92,Does taking coenzyme Q10 improve movement disorders in Parkinson's disease?,"No proven benefit of coenzyme Q10 However, this review results in a rather disappointing result: Movement disorders with coenzyme Q10 are likely to develop similar to those with a sham medication. This means that, according to current knowledge, coenzyme Q10 has no positive effect on Parkinson's typical movement disorders. However, evidence of ineffectiveness of coenzyme Q10 outweighs it. There are no significant differences between coenzyme Q10 and placebo, which would in principle be a good tolerability.",no,"Previous studies suggest that the intake of coenzyme Q10 does not tend to bring about any improvement in movement disorders typical of Parkinson's disease. However, this assessment is not well substantiated."
93,Does treatment with focused high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) reduce abdominal girth?,"Ultrasound treatment â€“ if at all â€“ should not have a great effect. Twelve weeks after the end of treatment, the abdominal circumference at the waist was one centimetre lower than after a dummy treatment without ultrasound. Compared to the sham treatment, it detected a reduction of one centimetre in the group with the highest ultrasonic intensity.",yes,"In a study with low significance, the abdominal circumference at the waist decreased by 1 cm after 3 months. In our estimation, this uncertain effect is very small or hardly visible."
94,Does sugar substitution increase the risk of developing or dying from cancer?,"No definitive results On erythritol and similar sugar alternatives (so-called sugar alcohols) we could not find any meaningful studies that investigated the association with cancer. In most studies, there was no clear connection: people who consumed, fell ill or died more frequently from cancer than people who used little, rare or never sweeteners. In spite of the large number of studies and participants, we are therefore currently unable to assess conclusively whether sweeteners actually increase the risk of cancer. We could not find a single comparative study on sugar alcohols such as erythritol, which investigated the relationship between this sweetener group and cancer. Results not clear In the review of the individual studies [1] and in the majority of recent studies [3-5], there is no clear link between the consumption of sweeteners and the risk of developing or dying of cancer.",unknown,"Most studies on sweeteners such as aspartame and cyclamate find no clear link. However, they all have major flaws, so the question cannot be answered with certainty at present. We were unable to find any meaningful studies at all on other sugar alternatives such as erythritol and xylitol."
95,Does ozonated vegetable oil help against athlete's foot or nail fungus?,"However, only with little success: For internal use (drips for swallowing) of ozonated vegetable oils we could not find any studies that are at least reasonably meaningful. The question whether ozonated oils help at least as well with various fungal infections as conventional drugs cannot be answered for us. For us, however, this is no evidence that ozonated oil is a good alternative to conventional anti-fungal agents.",unknown,We could not find any studies on these questions that we considered trustworthy.

97,Are health checks of symptom-free individuals (screening) effective in containing the pandemic?,"However, questioning and measuring fevers as screening unsuitable people for possible complaints, their itinerary or contacts with patients does not seem to provide reliable results. It is currently uncertain whether rapid tests at the airport, at the border or in health facilities can deliver reliable results and thus slow down the spread of the corona virus. According to these studies, both fever tests and surveys cannot reliably identify infected people as such. The research team cannot answer whether it can inhibit the spread of the Coronavirus to test complaint-free persons for the virus by means of a rapid test.",unknown,"Fever measurement at the border, questioning about complaints, or regular corona tests for health care workers: so-called screening involves examining people without complaints for a possible infection. Whether this can slow down the pandemic, however, is not well established. It is also unclear how reliably the series of health checks can distinguish infected from non-infected people. There is currently not enough solid data on this."
98,Does melatonin help against jet lag?,"Overall, the studies show that melatonin may help better against jetlag than a sham drug. Reliable statements on side effects of melatonin cannot be made on the basis of the studies. Difficult Summary In the systematic review work [1] four studies with a total of around 140 participants could be combined mathematically: According to this, people with melatonin have less jet-lag complaints than people who took a placebo.",yes,"The best available studies suggest that melatonin may be effective against jet lag problems. However, this assessment is not well supported."
99,Does sunscreen reduce the likelihood of skin cancer?,"The combined results of previous studies cannot clearly show that sunscreen reduces the risk of skin cancer [3,4]. Although studies have been carried out on this issue for 40 years, they are only limited in meaning and come to contradictory results. Both reviews are of high quality, have slightly different strengths and weaknesses, but come to the same conclusion: Due to the very different study results, an influence of sunscreen on the risk of skin cancer cannot be proven. However, we consider the significance of these studies to be very low.",unknown,"Although sunscreen protects the skin from sunburn, it has not yet been proven that it can also prevent skin cancer. The existing studies contradict each other. The problem is that the studies often did not take into account whether the participants applied the sunscreen correctly and regularly or whether the sun protection factor was sufficiently high."
100,Are international travel restrictions and border health checks effective in curbing the spread of covid-19?,"Some studies conclude that screenings at the border may be helpful to slow down the impact of the outbreak and reduce deaths a little. Rather, their evaluations would suggest that some travel-related control measures in the event of outbreaks of COVID-19, but also SARS and MERS, could have a positive impact on the outcome of the infection.",yes,"It may be that travel-related control measures lead to a reduction in the ""import"" and ""export"" of infections across borders. It could also be that the number of infected people increases more slowly. Health checks at the border could also identify previously undetected infections - but whether this will put a real damper on the pandemic is certainly questionable."
101,Does hypnosis help with smoking cessation?,"No convincing studies However, whether hypnosis actually helps with smoking cessation is not adequately investigated in studies [1]. It is also uncertain whether hypnosis works better than no therapy at all. Therefore, well-made studies are still needed to demonstrate effectiveness. In other studies, hypnosis therapy is hardly better than sham therapy (placebo treatment). Overall, there is no indication of a stronger effect of hypnosis therapy compared to behavioral therapy or other common methods.",unknown,"As things stand, the effectiveness of hypnosis for smoking cessation has not been proven. The study results are partly contradictory."
102,Does denosumab (Prolia) reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporosis?,"Denosumab was able to prevent such vertebral fractures in about 1 out of 100 female participants. Compared to some other osteoporosis agents, denosumab seems to be able to prevent vertebral fractures in some cases.",yes,The pooled results of studies to date show that denosumab reduces the risk of vertebral fractures more than a placebo. It may even be slightly more protective than single other osteoporosis drugs.  It cannot be ruled out that discontinuing denosumab increases the likelihood of vertebral fractures again. The studies on this are contradictory.
103,Does discontinuation of denosumab increase the risk of vertebral fractures???,"The consequences of discontinuation of denosumab are insufficiently investigated. However, it is unclear whether discontinuation actually leads to more bone fractures. Therefore, no reliable statements can be made from the data as to whether the discontinuation of denosumab leads to bone fractures.",unknown,The pooled results of studies to date show that denosumab reduces the risk of vertebral fractures more than a placebo. It may even be slightly more protective than single other osteoporosis drugs.  It cannot be ruled out that discontinuing denosumab increases the likelihood of vertebral fractures again. The studies on this are contradictory.
104,Does taking magnesium improve the symptoms of depression?,"Apart from the fact that this finding could not always be confirmed [2] : A statistical connection does not automatically mean that a low magnesium level is also the cause of depression â€“ and vice versa, that the depression is improved by magnesium intake. However, it cannot be concluded that magnesium is equivalent to an antidepressant. In the end, all of the depressive symptoms improved, with no difference between magnesium and placebo. Based on these studies, it is not certain whether magnesium actually helps with depression and would be a good alternative to an antidepressant or at least as an additional treatment.",unknown,The question has been investigated in only three small studies. These had several shortcomings and in some cases reached contradictory results.
105,Does focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment reduce wrinkles and sagging of the skin?,"Unproven allegation However, there is no scientific evidence of this effect. However, we could not find such studies â€“ despite extensive research in several research databases. What we have found are studies with very low significance, which have compared only different HIFU treatment strengths [1-3]. They cannot answer whether the HIFU method does anything.",unknown,"We did not find any conclusive studies. So whether HIFU has a visible effect is not solidly studied. However, there are reports of significant pain, redness and swelling."
106,Does a ketogenic diet help against cancer?,"So far, there is no evidence of the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in cancer. Effect on tumors so far unexplored This means that until today, the question that is actually relevant to cancer patients â€“ whether low-carbohydrate or non-carbohydrate diets can do something about cancer cells â€“ has hardly been investigated in humans. The few studies available so far do not report any or at most an unsafe anti-cancer effect of the ketogenic diet.",unknown,"To date, there are no well-done studies that have examined the effect of a ketogenic diet on cancer in humans. This involves eating little or no carbohydrates and sugar, but plenty of protein and fat. Experts take a critical view of ""cancer diets"" such as the ketogenic diet - they can also be dangerous."
107,Do curd compresses have an analgesic effect (e.g. for muscle and joint pain)? Do they have an antipyretic effect? Do curd compresses help breastfeeding women with lactation congestion?,"Nine years later, we too could not find meaningful research results on pot wrapping during an extensive research. But it is unclear whether pots also have a benefit. The fact that a quark pack helps just as well as a cool pack, however, cannot be shown by the examination â€“ because it is too deficient. However, how well they actually relieve pain and swelling is not well studied [3,4]. It is also unclear how pot wraps are supposed to relieve pain and inflammation.",unknown,We could not find any conclusive studies on curd wraps. Whether the effect goes beyond a cooling effect is unclear.
108,Does deuterium-reduced water prevent cancer?,"No statements can be derived from this on other cancers or even on protection against cancer. Unreliable For patients with prostate cancer, a benefit of deuterium-reduced water cannot be safely demonstrated with the study found, even if the author's team reports otherwise.",unknown,"We found only one study with prostate cancer patients comparing deuterium-reduced water with normal water. This small study has numerous flaws, so the results are not conclusive. We were unable to locate reliable studies on its use in other cancers or for cancer prevention."
109,Does deuterium-reduced water improve disease progression in cancer???,"The theoretical considerations for this have not necessarily convinced us: Laboratory and animal tests are reported on websites as an argument for deuterium-reduced water. Unreliable For patients with prostate cancer, a benefit of deuterium-reduced water cannot be safely demonstrated with the study found, even if the author's team reports otherwise. At least in our review, we came to the conclusion that there is no clear difference in mortality between the two groups, with a more appropriate method from our point of view.",unknown,"We found only one study with prostate cancer patients comparing deuterium-reduced water with normal water. This small study has numerous flaws, so the results are not conclusive. We were unable to locate reliable studies on its use in other cancers or for cancer prevention."
110,Can a special mattress relieve nighttime rheumatism symptoms and thus improve sleep?,"Many mattresses, no studies To this end, we have searched in several scientific databases for studies on rheumatism and mattresses â€“ but without success. It is currently impossible to answer whether a specific mattress can help those affected. The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated the effect of mattresses on rheumatism pain.",unknown,"During our research, we did not find any scientific studies on this. Therefore, we can not make any statement about the effect of special mattresses."
111,Do people with blood group AB have a higher risk of developing dementia?,"The result: None of the four known blood groups were remarkably common among people with dementia. The four blood groups A, B, AB and 0 were similarly distributed among dementia patients as among the healthy average population. Blood type AB: no panic However, bad results in thinking and memory tasks do not automatically mean that dementia begins. The study therefore provides no indication that the blood type was directly responsible for the mental impairments. The direct conclusion that blood type AB increases the risk of mental impairment is not confirmed by the results.",no,"The risk of dementia appears to be similar for people of all four blood groups (A, B, AB, 0). This was shown by two studies that evaluated data from more than 9,000 affected individuals. The claim spread in the media that the AB blood group increases the risk of dementia is therefore unlikely to be true."
112,Does therapeutic dancing help people with Parkinson's improve their movement problems?,"Small improvements â€“ perhaps In fact, the summarized results of previous studies suggest that dancing can help with Parkinson's disease â€“ at least a little [1]. Compared to no therapy, dancing improved movement restrictions by around 8 points on this scale. Compared to exercise therapy, dancing improved movement restrictions by around 2 points on this scale.",yes,"Dancing could somewhat improve the movement problems of affected people. It is also possible that dancing performs slightly better compared to other movement exercises. Nevertheless, it does not seem to increase the quality of life noticeably."
113,Is it possible to reliably detect coronavirus infection based only on symptoms but without laboratory testing?,"However, it appears that symptoms alone are not sufficient to reliably diagnose symptoms. Neither the presence of certain symptoms nor their absence makes it possible to conclude with high certainty on Covid-19 or to exclude the infection. At least at the moment, symptoms can only provide evidence that a more accurate investigation by means of a laboratory test is important.",no,"So far, no symptoms have emerged from which a covid 19 infection can be inferred with certainty. The absence of certain symptoms also does not allow an all-clear to be given. Thus, it appears that symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath or loss of smell are not suitable for making a diagnosis. Laboratory tests (""PCR tests"") are currently the safest option (as of August 2020)."
114,Are home coronavirus self-tests as reliable as tests performed by trained healthcare professionals?,"Do-it-yourself tests: Study situation thin We could not find any studies that investigated how reliable Corona self-tests are for home compared to professionally performed tests. Whether the do-it-yourself variant of the Corona test is just as good as the professionally performed test directly in the laboratory or the doctor's office, therefore remains unexplained. In this case, the test should be repeated approximately one or two days later [5].The studies in detail We could not find any studies on how reliable self-tests for home can detect an infection with the new Coronavirus â€“ compared to a test by professionals.",unknown,"Whether self-tests from the drugstore or pharmacy provide as reliable results as a test by trained health personnel has not yet been investigated. Errors are possible when taking the sample at home. Things can also go wrong in transit to the laboratory. This can affect the accuracy of the test result. But whether done by yourself or by trained personnel, even the best Corona test is not one hundred percent reliable."
115,Does biotin help with hair loss? Does biotin make hair grow faster?,"Unclear effect on hair loss and hair growth Our search for scientific evidence for the claimed effects of biotin remained unsuccessful. We can neither answer whether Biotin makes hair grow faster, nor can the vitamin stop hair loss. The scientists found no difference in hair growth between the biotin and placebo groups [1]. Evidence still has to be provided Whether biotin is effective or ineffective, we cannot say on this basis. The study concluded that the intake of biotin had no effect on hair growth.",unknown,"The number of studies dealing with the effect of biotin on hair growth is insufficient. According to current research, a positive effect has not been confirmed."
116,Can induction of labor prevent infant deaths in pregnancies that go beyond the estimated due date? Does it reduce the number of neonatal intensive care unit stays?,"The most important results: Birth initiations can be lifesaving for babies. In the case of inductions, there are fewer deaths of babies immediately before or after birth than during observation and waiting. Due to the artificial triggering of the birth a little less stays in an intensive care unit are necessary for the newborns.",yes,"The summary of 34 strong studies involving 21,500 women shows that birth inductions can prevent baby deaths and neonatal intensive care unit stays - compared to observational waiting. Cesarean sections are likely to be needed less often with inductions than with waiting. The use of a suction cup and forceps is unlikely to change much, if at all. The results apply to women with no special risks and in the case that the pregnancy continues beyond the expected delivery date."
117,Does induction of labor make cesarean sections less necessary than observational waiting?,"Less caesarean sections For pregnant women without special risk, an introduction probably means a slightly lower risk for a caesarean section. In figures, according to overview work [1], expressed as follows: With introduction 16.7% of women had a caesarean section Without introduction 18.6% of women had a caesarean section.",yes,"The summary of 34 strong studies involving 21,500 women shows that birth inductions can prevent baby deaths and neonatal intensive care unit stays - compared to observational waiting. Cesarean sections are likely to be needed less often with inductions than with waiting. The use of a suction cup and forceps is unlikely to change much, if at all. The results apply to women with no special risks and in the case that the pregnancy continues beyond the expected delivery date."
118,Does the number of deliveries with a vacuum cup and forceps remain similar with induction and observational waiting???,Due to the artificial triggering of the birth a little less stays in an intensive care unit are necessary for the newborns.,yes,"The summary of 34 strong studies involving 21,500 women shows that birth inductions can prevent baby deaths and neonatal intensive care unit stays - compared to observational waiting. Cesarean sections are likely to be needed less often with inductions than with waiting. The use of a suction cup and forceps is unlikely to change much, if at all. The results apply to women with no special risks and in the case that the pregnancy continues beyond the expected delivery date."
119,"Does taking supplements with omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or other sudden cardiovascular problems?  Does it lower the risk of dying prematurely?","Individuals who had taken additional omega-3 fatty acids suffered a heart attack, stroke or similar acute illness as those who had taken a dummy preparation (placebo) in the course of the study. Omega-3 fatty acids: without effect on the heart and vessels In the summary, the studies showed that omega-3 fatty acids have no influence on the risk of premature death. Also, the intake of additional omega-3 fatty acids did not seem to be able to prolong life.",no,The summarized results of studies to date clearly show that dietary supplements with omega-3 fatty acids do not protect against acute cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. The same applies to diets particularly rich in omega-3s.  Additional omega-3 fatty acids also cannot reduce the general risk of premature death.
120,"Can taking dietary supplements with omega-3 fatty acids prevent further heart attacks or strokes if one has already had a heart attack?  In this case, does it lower the risk of dying prematurely??","Their conclusion: Additional omega-3 fatty acids probably cannot protect against further heart attacks or strokes. Omega-3 fatty acids: without effect on the heart and vessels In the summary, the studies showed that omega-3 fatty acids have no influence on the risk of premature death. Also ""Relapses are not likely to be prevented"" A second, equally carefully done review study examined whether the increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids can prevent further diseases if the subjects examined have already had a heart attack [2]. However, it is likely that additional omega-3 fatty acids cannot provide protection even after a heart attack.",no,The summarized results of studies to date clearly show that dietary supplements with omega-3 fatty acids do not protect against acute cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. The same applies to diets particularly rich in omega-3s.  Additional omega-3 fatty acids also cannot reduce the general risk of premature death.
121,Can cosmetic products with caffeine for hair and scalp help against hereditary hair loss?,"Likewise, we did not find any studies on the effect of caffeine in other forms of hair loss. Whether caffeine shampoo and co. work in practice can therefore not be answered on the basis of these results. What really does it do to wash your hair with caffeine shampoo and use other cosmetic products with caffeine, however, is unclear. We do not consider this result to be trustworthy.",unknown,"Caffeine can penetrate the hair root and prolong the hair growth phase there - at least if the hair loss is hereditary (androgenetic alopecia). At least, this is what studies from the laboratory indicate. Whether caffeine shampoo or other cosmetic products containing caffeine help women and men with hereditary hair loss is not yet clear. Reliable research is still lacking."
122,Is music therapy with rhythmic training helpful for people with Parkinson's who have trouble walking?,"Rhythmic walking training: Possible small improvement There are many forms of music therapy. It suggests that rhythmic training could slightly increase walking speed. The average effect, however, does not seem to be particularly large: without rhythmic training, the participants went about 56.5 meters per minute With rhythmic training, the participants went about 60 meters per minute After the training, the participants travelled about 3.5 meters more per minute [1].",yes,"Music therapy with rhythmic training could help Parkinson's sufferers walk a little faster and more safely. However, the effect is unlikely to be very great."
123,Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"The study team reports that in some of the subjects the pain and movement restrictions improved a little â€“ in those with a knee arthritis and only a maximum of 6 months observation period. In case of osteoarthritis in the knee, preparations with avocado and soya oil can probably alleviate the discomfort â€“ at least in the short term. Participants with knee arthrosis were likely to benefit from the therapy â€“ and to a noticeable extent.",yes,There is evidence of minor efficacy of preparations containing avocado and soybean oil (ASU). They can probably somewhat alleviate movement restrictions and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint - at least in the short term. An effect in osteoarthritis of the hip joint has not yet been shown. Side effects are not to be expected.
124,Do preparations with unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU) help against limitations and pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint?,"In contrast, the participants were not better off with a hip arthritis. This obviously does not apply to arthrosis in the hip joint. The ASU preparations apparently do not relieve pain and movement restrictions under these conditions.",no,There is evidence of minor efficacy of preparations containing avocado and soybean oil (ASU). They can probably somewhat alleviate movement restrictions and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint - at least in the short term. An effect in osteoarthritis of the hip joint has not yet been shown. Side effects are not to be expected.
125,Is it safe to take preparations containing unsaponifiable components of avocado and soybean oils (ASU)?,"Participants taking an ASU preparation reported adverse reactions as frequently (or rarely) as participants in the placebo groups. We consider the result to be trustworthy: Therefore, preparations with ASU are safe.",yes,There is evidence of minor efficacy of preparations containing avocado and soybean oil (ASU). They can probably somewhat alleviate movement restrictions and pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint - at least in the short term. An effect in osteoarthritis of the hip joint has not yet been shown. Side effects are not to be expected.
126,Can taking chondroitin relieve osteoarthritis pain or improve mobility in the long term?,"However, studies so far probably do not indicate that chondroitin can help people with osteoarthritis. The combined research results [1-9] show that chondroitin intake probably does not improve pain or mobility. However, the summarized results of previous studies show that also the combination of chondroitin and glucosamine may not relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis [1,4,6,7,9]. The result is similar in all nine cases: a noticeable improvement of the symptoms due to chondroitin is unlikely.",no,"In the studies conducted to date, chondroitin did not lead to any noticeable overall improvement in the symptoms of osteoarthritis. However, the results differ from one another in some cases. This limits their significance somewhat."
127,Does taking arginine benefit existing cardiovascular disease or does arginine prevent it from developing?,"After three months, the results of the two groups were compared and the study authors came to a rather sobering result: In the Arginin group, neither quality of life nor physical resilience of the participants had improved compared to the placebo group. Due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the study, the compatibility of arginine with these data cannot be assessed. From our point of view, it is also questionable how well the results of this study with heart failure sufferers are transferable to people with other types of cardiovascular disease.",unknown,"We found only one small study that investigated a benefit that was noticeable for those affected. In patients with heart failure, taking arginine did not improve exercise tolerance or quality of life. Due to a lack of details, we cannot conclusively assess how reliable these results are. Therefore, we cannot make any statements on the benefit of arginine."
128,"Does ""Detoxic"" work against tapeworms and other parasites? Does ""Detoxic"" help with health complaints?","And even extensive research in three international research databases did not reveal any studies on ""Detoxic"". There is no evidence that their extracts could help with worm infestation or other parasites â€“ either individually or in combination. The studies in detail We could not find any studies on ""Detoxic"".",unknown,"There are no published studies on ""Detoxic"". The claimed effects cannot be verified and seem frivolous."
129,Is mannose as good as or better than antibiotics for preventing recurrent cystitis?,"Overall, therefore, there is no certainty at this stage whether mannosis is actually effective and safe when it comes to preventing bladder inflammation. Therefore, it is not certain whether mannosis is actually better tolerated than an antibiotic.",unknown,"In two studies, bladder infections occurred with a similar frequency or even less frequently with mannose than with an antibiotic. However, the studies are so poorly done that the results are not trustworthy."
130,Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of spinal fractures in older women?,"No benefit â€“ or at most a small one The results of the studies, however, are rather disappointing: vertebral fractures could not be safely prevented with vitamin K. In the case of fractures on other bones, the overall benefit was small: without vitamin K, 30 out of 1000 people had broken bones.",no,"Taking vitamin K probably does not reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. However, this assessment is not well supported. The risk of other bone fractures could possibly be reduced - but only slightly. This estimate is also subject to some uncertainty."
131,Does taking vitamin K lower the risk of other bone fractures in older women?,"Thus, the intake of vitamin K could save 8 out of 1000 people a bone fracture. However, the estimate for the protective effect of vitamin K is subject to considerable uncertainty â€“ it could also be significantly smaller. Thus, the current study situation suggests that vitamin K â€“ if at all â€“ only to a very small extent protects older women with osteoporosis from bone fractures.",yes,"Taking vitamin K probably does not reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. However, this assessment is not well supported. The risk of other bone fractures could possibly be reduced - but only slightly. This estimate is also subject to some uncertainty."
132,Does Smartsleep provide better or more restful sleep?,"Despite extensive research in several medical research databases, we could not find efficacy studies on smart sleep. There is no evidence of sleep-improving effects. The studies in detail We have not found any studies on Smartsleep.",unknown,"There are no studies on this dietary supplement. Whether Smartsleep has a positive effect on sleep must first be scientifically researched. According to the manufacturer, a clinical study on this is in progress."
133,"Can supplemental tryptophan, taken as a dietary supplement or with food, help with depression?","Researched for a long time, but not proven Whether a diet with many tryptophan-rich foods has a beneficial effect on depression, we cannot say. Whether from food or in the form of pills: Whether tryptophan actually relieves the symptoms of depression, the science cannot answer (currently) because of lack of good studies. Although future studies may be able to draw a clearer picture, we do not think it is very likely that tryptophan alone can have great effects. The results can neither show nor refute the effect of tryptophan against depression. Whether or not tryptophan can make antidepressant therapy more effective remains unclear.",unknown,"The amino acid tryptophan appears again and again as a possible treatment for depression. However, an effect could not be scientifically proven so far. Significant studies on tryptophan against depression are lacking."
134,Can Neuro-Socks relieve pain or improve balance and stability?,"Thus, how the neuro-socks should relieve pain or promote stability and strength through touch stimuli on the sole of the foot was not comprehensible to us on the usual research path. However, when we look more closely, it quickly becomes clear from our point of view that these studies have no significance. However, the evaluation is incomplete and does not allow any conclusions. Since essential information on the course of the study is missing, this result is neither comprehensible nor trustworthy.",unknown,There is no scientific evidence of such an effect.
135,"Does taking blood pressure medication in the evening prevent more heart attacks, strokes, and other acute cardiovascular diseases?","Whether this also leads to a lower risk of heart attack, stroke and co is open in most studies. Therefore, despite the fairly large studies, it is still unclear whether the intake in the evening is actually better than the intake in the morning. Therefore, we cannot estimate whether the supposed benefits in the evening group are actually due to the blood pressure sinks or at least partly to other medications.",unknown,"According to two large studies, taking antihypertensive drugs in the evening should significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and similar acute cardiovascular diseases compared with taking them in the morning. However, the described effect is on the one hand rather uncertain and on the other hand not very plausible. Therefore, it is not possible to say whether evening intake is actually better. The larger of the two studies will be reviewed again (as of June 2020)."
136,"In Covid-19, do nicotine or smoking have a protective effect, i.e., do they prevent severe progression or death?","Therefore, we can't draw any conclusions and can't even read out the possible protective effect of nicotine. Whether smokers are suffering from a severe form of Covid-19 can not be answered. However, it is by no means suitable to suggest a protective effect of nicotine and smoking.",unknown,"An observational study from a Paris hospital cited in many media is not suitable to support this hypothesis. On the contrary, according to the current state of knowledge, it is plausible that smokers could have an increased risk with Covid-19. They may be more likely to have a severe course of corona infection, necessitating ventilation or death."
137,Can red mold rice products lower blood cholesterol levels?,"The summarized results of previous studies show that redhead rice probably has a favourable influence on high cholesterol levels [1,2]. According to analysis, redhead rice products can reduce elevated cholesterol levels similarly well as the common medicine simvastatin. Again, the author's team found indications that the rice products can have a beneficial influence on cholesterol levels.",yes,"Red mold rice naturally contains the substance lovastatin, which acts as a cholesterol-lowering agent. The concentration of lovastatin in products made from red mold rice can vary greatly. Therefore, it is not certain that red mold rice is as effective as drugs containing a controlled amount of lovastatin. Depending on the dosage, undesirable side effects from red mold rice are possible - just as with the ""real"" drugs."
138,Do products made from red mold rice have fewer side effects than cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins???,"""Of course, but not harmless In addition to its positive effects, lovastatin may also cause unpleasant to serious side effects. According to several experts, redhead rice in effect and side effects is too similar to a medicine to go through as a harmless dietary supplement [4,11.12].",no,"Red mold rice naturally contains the substance lovastatin, which acts as a cholesterol-lowering agent.

139,Can disinfectants containing highly diluted sodium hypochlorite (below 0.1%) render corona and other viruses harmless and thus protect against infection?,"Evidence that sodium hypochlorite frees hands from disease-causing viruses is missing. Skin effect unclear It is therefore unclear whether a disinfectant with less than 0.1% sodium hypochlorite is strong enough to reliably eliminate viruses. So it is quite questionable whether sodium hypochlorite on the hands unfolds its anti-virus effect as well as on clean steel. However, it remains unclear whether highly diluted sodium hypochlorite solutions are still sufficiently strong against viruses. The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated the effect of solutions with sodium hypochlorite or electrolytically activated water on hand disinfection against corona and other viruses.",unknown,"Whether disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite reliably rid hands of viruses has never been investigated in scientific studies. However, studies on the disinfection of surfaces suggest: The low concentration of sodium hypochlorite may not be sufficient for reliable disinfection of hands."
140,Does cat's claw improve joint disease symptoms?,"Many questions open Whether cat claw helps better in rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis than a placebo cannot be reliably estimated on the basis of the available studies. We can't make any statements about effectiveness. Since both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are chronic diseases, no conclusions can be drawn about the longer-term positive and negative effects of cat claws.",unknown,"We found three small studies that investigated cat's claw in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. The studies have significant flaws and sometimes come to contradictory results. Therefore, the question cannot be answered unequivocally."
141,Do essential oils protect against corona infections and other viral infections like colds or flu?,"There was no difference between those who swallowed the oils and those who took a sham medication (placebo). In addition, we could not find any studies that investigated the effect of essential oils directly on humans. It is questionable whether a room air treated with essential oils can prevent them.",unknown,"In laboratory tests, some essential oils can successfully kill viruses. Whether spraying, inhaling or swallowing the oils also protects against infections with viruses such as the Corona virus in real life is unclear. It has not been scientifically studied yet."
142,Do air purifiers help relieve symptoms of allergic asthma?,"They suggest that air purifiers cannot improve a number of symptoms: the lungs of the study participants were not more efficient when using an air purifier than without, the sufferers could not reduce their asthma medications, and the disease did not seem to progress more slowly [1]. It is also not clear whether it makes sense to use air purifiers as part of a treatment concept: they do not seem to be able to control asthma better. No statements on current air purifiers The summarized results of previous studies suggest that air purifiers in normal households are not able to significantly reduce the number of allergens in indoor air [1]. It comes to the result described that symptoms cannot improve, medication cannot be reduced, deteriorations cannot be stopped and allergens are not sufficiently removed from the air.",no,"In our literature search, we found no evidence that air purifiers can help control allergic asthma. According to previous studies, they are unlikely to filter enough allergenic substances from indoor air to relieve symptoms or reduce medication."
143,Is special baby water better for infants than tap water?,Only studies from countries with a lack of hygiene Whether bottled water has a health benefit for babies and is therefore better than tap water has not been investigated scientifically. The amount of plastic waste left after a few swallows is another criticism.The studies in detail We could not find any studies that investigated whether special baby water is better suited for infants than tap water.,unknown,"Whether special baby water is healthier for infants than tap water has not been scientifically studied. In principle, however, tap water in Austria is also suitable for babies. Boiling tap water is no longer necessary after the sixth month of life."
144,Does platelet-rich plasma therapy (autologous blood therapy) reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee joint?,"Less pain possible Treatment may reduce knee pain better than sham treatment, but the effect is likely to be low. Treatment can cause the function of a joint to be maintained for longer, wear can be slowed down, or pain can simply be improved.",yes,"Injections with platelet-rich plasma could slightly reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee. The therapy is apparently more effective than placebo treatment, but the effect is small.  For the hip, on the other hand, studies tend to point toward no efficacy. Local side effects are common. Which form of therapy is best for whom has not yet been clarified, and long-term success has not been studied."
145,Does platelet-rich plasma therapy (autologous blood therapy) reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the hip joint???,Knees and hips are the large joints that are particularly affected and for which various injections are offered as therapy.,no,"Injections with platelet-rich plasma could slightly reduce pain in osteoarthritis of the knee. The therapy is apparently more effective than placebo treatment, but the effect is small.  For the hip, on the other hand, studies tend to point toward no efficacy. Local side effects are common.

146,"Can vitamin D supplements prevent colds, flu, colds, and other viral respiratory illnesses when there is no or only a mild deficiency of vitamin D?","Vitamin D: Colds not rare According to the current state of knowledge, vitamin D preparations probably do not protect against respiratory infections caused by viruses. The participants all had similar common cold diseases â€“ regardless of whether they took a vitamin D preparation or a dummy medication. With normal or moderately low levels of vitamin D, the additional vitamin D probably has no effect on the risk of colds. The researchers found that people who swallowed a larger amount of vitamin D every three months (over 30,000 IU) had as many colds as the placebo group. Side effects unlikely The conclusion of the review: For people who have no or only a moderate deficiency, vitamin D preparations are probably not effective to prevent colds.",no,"Taking vitamin D probably has no preventive effect against infections with cold, cold and flu viruses. This is true at least for people with normal or moderately low levels of vitamin D in their blood. If there is a severe deficiency, however, the immune system is likely to benefit from treatment with vitamin D."
147,Does ACE inhibitors like ramipril increase the risk of lung cancer?,"Contradictory results Previous studies also had problems in providing a clear answer. The research has produced contradictory results: in some cases, the risk of lung cancer was increased with ACE inhibitors, decreased or not altered in others. Therefore, it is not certain whether the relationship found is really due to the ACE inhibitors.",unknown,"A large observational study has found an increased risk of lung cancer with long-term use of ACE inhibitors compared with another group of antihypertensive drugs. However, other causes for this association cannot be completely ruled out. Previous studies have reached inconsistent results. Therefore, it can currently neither be confirmed nor ruled out that the risk of lung cancer may increase with ACE inhibitors. Even if further studies should really confirm the increased risk, the effect is likely to be rather small."
148,"Does propolis have a preventive or soothing effect against infection with coronavirus, colds or flu?","Scientifically meaningful evidence of an infection-preventing effect of Propolis could not be found despite intensive search. Because so far studies have not investigated whether the use of Propolis can protect against the Coronavirus. However, it is not possible to conclude that Propolis alone is effective from a combination product. However, the fact that the use of Propolis can also prevent viral infections is a fallacy.",unknown,"To date, there are no studies that have investigated the effect of propolis in these viral infections."
149,Does DAILY administration of HIGH-dose atropine (0.5 - 1%) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children?,"One year after the end of the two-year daily atropin treatment, the advantage over the untreated children was no longer noticeable. In the short term, less diopters In the three studies, the results were similar with daily drop-in at bedtime: at the end of treatment with 0.5 â€“ 1% atropine, the short-sightedness was about 1 dioptrie lower than in the placebo group [1.3,4.7].",no,"Drip-feeding high-dose atropine for 1-3 years probably inhibits the progression of myopia in the short term. If dripping is done daily, the effect does not seem to be noticeable 1 year after the end of treatment. If dripping is done monthly at first and then every 2 months, the effect is likely to last longer. Whether lower-dose atropine helps in the long term is poorly understood."
150,Does MONTHLY administered HIGH-dose atropine (1%) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children?,"High dose effective in the short term We have found four studies on high dose atropine. School children who had eye drops containing atropine saw better than children who had drops without atropin at the end of the therapy. If the children got 1 % atropine per month for 2 years and every 2 months in the third year, they were even 2 diopters less [8].",yes,"Drip-feeding high-dose atropine for 1-3 years probably inhibits the progression of myopia in the short term. If dripping is done daily, the effect does not seem to be noticeable 1 year after the end of treatment. If dripping is done monthly at first and then every 2 months, the effect is likely to last longer. Whether lower-dose atropine helps in the long term is poorly understood."
151,Does LOW dose atropine (0.05% or less) sustainably inhibit the progression of myopia in children???,"Therefore, the study cannot answer how well atropine works at a concentration of 0.01% or 0.1%.",unknown,"Drip-feeding high-dose atropine for 1-3 years probably inhibits the progression of myopia in the short term. If dripping is done daily, the effect does not seem to be noticeable 1 year after the end of treatment. If dripping is done monthly at first and then every 2 months, the effect is likely to last longer. Whether lower-dose atropine helps in the long term is poorly understood."
152,Is quarantining persons who have had contact with infected persons or who enter from high-risk areas an effective measure to reduce the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths?,"In their review, the researchers concluded that quarantine should be an effective measure. There is also evidence that the quarantine of returning travellers from risk areas can help to reduce the spread. They support the assumption that the precautionary withdrawal of potentially infected people from public life is an important contribution to contain the pandemic. Quarantine alone is too little The research team stresses, however, that even if an early and strict quarantine seems to be effective â€“ as a sole measure to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is probably not sufficient. Despite the methodological weaknesses, the studies mainly point in one direction: the isolation of potentially infected persons without symptoms seems to reduce the number of cases of infection and deaths â€“ especially at an early start and in combination with other measures such as school closures and social/physical distancing.",yes,"The analysis of 29 studies suggests that quarantine can prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The validity of the studies to date is diminished by the fact that only mathemathic modeling studies are available for coronavirus. However, observational studies and modeling of the related diseases SARS and MERS show much the same thing: precautionary quarantine of those who may be infected is likely to be effective, especially if the action is taken early. As a stand-alone measure, quarantine is unlikely to be sufficient to sustainably contain the pandemic."
153,Can homeopathic globules protect against infection with the novel coronavirus?,"After studies on homeopathy against coronaviruses one is looking in vain. Whether globuli can do anything against the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has never been scientifically verified. Our conclusion: Based on the available scientific studies, we can currently assume that homeopathic remedies themselves have no effect.",unknown,"There is no evidence that globules can protect against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Scientifically, this has never been investigated.  However, studies on other viral diseases, such as the common cold, show: a curative effect of homeopathy has not been proven."
154,Does the osteoporosis drug teriparatide increase the risk of bone cancer as a side effect?,"However, in these studies [1-4] there was no clear association between teriparatide treatment and osteosarcoma disease. Many questions open Therefore, it is not clear at this stage whether teriparatide actually increases the risk of osteosarcoma and how large this effect may be. No association between treatment with teriparatide and the development of osteosarcoma has been observed.",unknown,"The suspicion that teriparatide could cause bone cancer as a side effect is based on animal studies on the one hand. On the other hand, there are individual cases of bone cancer in people treated with teriparatide - although a causal relationship cannot be clearly proven here. Systematic studies of people treated with teriparatide could not provide clear results. Since bone cancer is a very rare disease, its risk factors are difficult to pin down in studies."
155,Can therapy with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) alleviate the symptoms of people with post-traumatic stress disorder?,"Probably effective Our research revealed that people with post-traumatic stress disorder are probably better off after a psychotherapy with EMDR than people who have not received any psychotherapeutic treatment at all. Our conclusion With EMDR therapy, post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to improve more than completely without therapy. That they are effective has been shown in well conducted studies [1].Studies in detail Since the 1990s, the topic of trauma therapy has been intensively researched using EMDR. The result: with EMDR therapy, the subjects had less complaints than without any treatment.",yes,Therapy with EMDR is probably more effective than no therapy at all for people suffering from the psychological consequences of a traumatic experience. Its effectiveness may be similar to that of exposure therapy. This is a widely established and well-studied form of psychotherapy.
156,"Does EMDR work similarly to exposure therapy, another well-studied form of psychotherapy for the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder???","Perhaps as effective as established therapy We have also researched how well EMDR therapy works compared to well-established exposure therapy â€“ a common form of psychotherapy for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. There is evidence that EMDR works similarly well as established exposure therapy, i.e. The comparison of EMDR and cognitive behavioral therapy suggests that both forms of therapy help similarly well.",yes,Therapy with EMDR is probably more effective than no therapy at all for people suffering from the psychological consequences of a traumatic experience. Its effectiveness may be similar to that of exposure therapy. This is a widely established and well-studied form of psychotherapy.
157,Does filling with hydrogel help with chronic back pain caused by a worn disc?,"And as beautiful as the image of the ""gel-improved intervertebral disc"" may be, the theory is relatively shaky: the wear of the intervertebral disc does not have to be the cause of the back pain, even if it has been detected with X-ray, computer tomopgraphy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nor can the studies prove that Hydrogel can significantly improve the height of the intervertebral discs. However, the studies cannot answer whether the pain would have improved without hydrogel â€“ because none had a control group.",unknown,None of the studies to date can answer how well the treatment works - they lack conclusiveness for this. Some hydrogel products have since been withdrawn from the market.
158,Does taking hyaluronic acid in capsule form improve the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis?,"So we don't know if taking hyaluronic acid capsules can relieve the discomfort of knee arthrosis. These differences make it difficult to make general statements about oral hyaluronic acid. Contradictory results The results are also contradictory: one study [1] could not detect any difference between hyaluronic acid and a dummy drug, another [2] only in a few aspects examined.",unknown,"The question was examined in three small studies with various shortcomings. They come to contradictory results. Therefore, we cannot say for sure whether hyaluronic acid for oral use has a beneficial effect on the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. We are also unable to make any reliable statements about possible risks on the basis of the best available studies."
159,"Does taking chlorella provide better performance, more resilience and does it promote health?","Unfortunately, the study with only 27 participants is very small, and important information is missing in order to be able to derive statements about possible positive effects. All in all, we cannot say whether the intake of chlorella has any tangible benefit for healthy adults. Unfortunately, we cannot deduce from the reported results whether there was a clear difference between the chlorella and placebo groups in exhaustion at the end of the study. Therefore, no reliable findings can be derived from this.",unknown,"We have found only one very small study on this topic with completely unclear results. From this, we cannot derive any statements on the benefits and risks of dietary supplements from chlorella algae."
160,Does going to the sauna several times a week prolong men's lives?,"We have found two meaningful research papers [1,2]: One of them indicates a life-prolonging effect in men [1]. The more frequent the sauna visits, the less likely the participants were to die 21 years later. The more often the participants were in the sauna, the less likely they had died 21 years later.",yes,"Men who go to the sauna several times a week live longer than those who go only once a week. However, it is possible that this is not due to the sauna at all. For women, the effect of sauna visits has not been sufficiently researched."
161,Does going to the sauna several times a week prolong women's lives???,"In a second study [2] 867 Finnish women participated over a period of 15 years. The study data cannot prove, but cannot exclude, a connection with a reduced risk of death. On the basis of the data, it is not possible to confirm or exclude whether more frequent visits to saunas to the participating women are associated with a reduced probability of death.",unknown,"Men who go to the sauna several times a week live longer than those who go only once a week. However, it is possible that this is not due to the sauna at all. For women, the effect of sauna visits has not been sufficiently researched."
162,Does the additional offer of HIV self-testing cause more people to take an HIV test?,"HIV self-tests are attractive Overall, the nine international studies conclude that the supply of HIV self-tests is likely to lead to more people passing an HIV test. Thus, an extended range of self-tests is likely to lead to more people taking an HIV test globally. Apparently, the supply of HIV self-tests leads to more tests, especially in those groups, which make little use of the already existing offer.",yes,"Current research provides very strong evidence that the addition of HIV self-testing leads to more people taking an HIV test. Among others, people for whom testing at health facilities by professionals is not acceptable for various reasons also make use of this offer."
163,"Can the combination of propolis, xyloglucan, gelatin and hibiscus (product ""Utipro Plus"") relieve the symptoms of cystitis or prevent cystitis?","We could not find any studies on the effect of xyloglucan, gelatin, hibiscus or propolis as a single agent against bladder inflammation. Whether pain and burning in the Utipro group have improved more than in the placebo group cannot be read out from the study â€“ an analysis of the symptom progression would, in our view, be much more meaningful. No statements possible Two studies [1,2] have also investigated whether Utipro Plus can prevent further bladder inflammation.",unknown,"Three studies on the product ""Utipro Plus"" investigated the combination of these ingredients. However, statements on the efficacy cannot be made, as the studies have various shortcomings. We did not find any studies on the ingredients - used individually."
164,Does PEMF noticeably improve pain in osteoarthritis? Does the method improve mobility and quality of life in sufferers?,"Overall, the studies available do not convince us that the pulsating magnetic field therapy in osteoarthritis brings a clear benefit to the sufferers. There was no difference in the side effects between PEMF treatment and sham therapy. In view of the few available data, however, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions on the safety of PEMF in osteoarthritis.",unknown,"Pain was investigated in eight small rather flawed studies. The studies arrived at widely divergent answers. In the studies with positive results, it is partly unclear whether the difference was actually noticeable for those affected. Quality of life and mobility were investigated in five and two studies, respectively - these were small and of little significance. In addition, the studies came to contradictory results."
165,Does oil pulling promote dental health?,"However, the investigations are too short, they have too many shortcomings and the results are too inaccurate to prove that. The effect of oil pulling on dental health remains unclear â€“ at least as long as there are no meaningful studies that have been carried out according to strict scientific criteria. However, this does not prove that oil pulling prevents gum inflammation as well as antibacterial chlorhexidine. Otherwise, the studies are too inadequate to be meaningful. The real question remains unanswered: Can oil pulling better promote dental health in the long term than rinsing with a rinsing solution without an active ingredient?",unknown,"Studies conducted to date have been poorly done and are not conclusive. Thus, they cannot answer this question."
166,Can injecting stem cells into the knee joint relieve pain and limitations associated with osteoarthritis?,"Whether the therapy can appreciably relieve pain and movement restrictions in case of knee arthritis remains unclear [1]. Our conclusion: At the moment, the therapy with stem cells in the case of arthrosis in the knee is not matured. Because whether the stem cells arrived in the knee actually do what they should do and form new cartilage is also uncertain. Effect probably not noticeable The result: according to statistical analysis, the test subjects from the stem cell group had less pain on average.",unknown,It is unclear whether stem cells injected into the knee for osteoarthritis have a curative effect.  Possible side effects and dangers are also insufficiently researched.
167,Can an extract of Desmodium promote liver health or relieve other ailments?,"Whether desmodium improves the function of the liver or even heals liver damage, has apparently not been researched in meaningful studies. The studies in detail We could not find meaningful studies on Desmodium.",unknown,We found no conclusive studies on the efficacy of Desmodium - neither on liver health nor for any other application.
168,Does the balsam apple help against infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"However, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from laboratory tests alone on the benefits and risks of treatment. No studies with humans We could not find studies with human subjects. Therefore, we cannot answer whether extracts from the balsam apple may be considered as treatment for HIV infection in the future.",unknown,"Laboratory experiments have tested how proteins from the fruits and seeds of the balsam apple Momordica behave against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, studies with humans are still lacking."
169,Does healing clay with the clay mineral smectite help when children have diarrhea?,"One day shorter For healing soil with the clay mineral smectite, there is evidence of at least minor efficacy. According to the best available studies, Smectit-Heilerde could shorten the duration of the diarrhea by around a day, i.e. The summarized results of the studies suggest that smectite shortens the duration of diarrhoea by about 24 hours.",yes,"Healing clay with smectite could shorten a diarrheal illness in children by about one day. For healing clay with kaolinite or loess, the effectiveness is unclear."
170,"Does a herbal combination preparation of rosemary, lovage, and centaury effectively relieve symptoms of uncomplicated cystitis?","Laboratory and animal tests indicate that ingredients of rosemary, lovage and millenium wort can relieve inflammation and cramps. The study teams concluded in the publications that the vegetable resource was effective for both purposes. From our point of view, there are cautious indications of a relieving effect in case of acute uncomplicated bladder inflammation [1] â€“ but many questions remain open at the same time.",yes,
171,"Can a herbal combination preparation of rosemary, lovage and centaury prevent recurrent cystitis in women?",We do not consider a preventive effect to be sufficiently substantiated on the basis of the study available to us [2]. Not meaningful enough The study on the prevention of recurrent bladder inflammation [2] is very small with only 90 participants and has serious deficiencies.,unknown,
172,Can healing clay help with gastritis?,"Despite intensive research in several research databases, we could not find meaningful studies in which the effect of healing soil was investigated. Thus, there is no evidence that healing earth relieves problems with gastritis. The studies in detail We could not find meaningful studies on the effect of healing soil in gastritis.",unknown,We could not find a meaningful study that scientifically examined this question.
173,Does the Indian spice paste Chyawanprash have a positive effect on adult health?,"Even if the taking of Chyawanprash in India has a long tradition â€“ we cannot give an assessment of these almost fairytale-sounding praises. Unfortunately, the few scientific studies on the effects of Chyawanprash do not allow any statements as to whether the mus can develop positive health effects. No standards, no proofs If Chyawanprash â€“ for which there are many spellings â€“ actually should have one or other long-term positive effect, a proof is likely to be difficult. Consequently, no clear statements about the concentration of potentially health-promoting active substances are possible [4,5].The studies in detail On the subject of Chyawanprash, scientific literature is quite poor. No statements possible The only study [1] that we were able to evaluate is from 2014.",unknown,There is a lack of conclusive studies on possible health effects of Chyawanprash. We can neither confirm nor deny a beneficial effect.
174,Does ginger work against breast cancer?,"However, it is questionable which ingredients in ginger are responsible for these effects and which processes they trigger in detail. Because we have not found a single study with human subjects on this question. We cannot, therefore, say whether ginger or not.",unknown,"So far, only isolated animal studies and experiments with cells indicate that ginger substances could favorably influence the behavior of breast cancer cells. Studies with breast cancer patients are lacking. Therefore, there are no data on the efficacy"
175,Can Theta Healing help with physical ailments and mental problems?,"However, we have found a study [1] that calls into question the alleged basic principle of the mental healing method. The research team was not able to detect an increase in the theta waves among any of the persons involved. In addition, the study did not check whether theta healing actually has a relieving or healing effect on symptoms.",unknown,"There are no studies that have directly examined the healing effects of Theta Healing. However, one experiment contradicts a basic assumption of the method: According to this, there is no evidence that increased theta brain waves occur in involved persons."
176,Does taking Bacopa extract improve memory performance?,"We have found no better memory by Bacopa a systematic overview [1], which has summarized nine studies with around 500 participants. The conclusion, however, comes to a disappointing conclusion: All in all, it could not be proven that the Bacopa extract actually effectively improves memory and/or attention. On the contrary, it seems that Bacopa should not have the desired effect. No clear evidence of benefit For the vast majority of tests, the systematic review of the individual studies did not reveal any clear effects of the Bacopa extract.",no,"The question was investigated in several mainly properly done studies with more than 500 people. Overall, no significant positive effects on memory and attention were found. Since some of the studies arrived at very different results and the estimates were far apart, this clearly limits the significance of the result."
177,"Do remedies containing the trifoliate fruit alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (""rheumatism"")?","They come to the conclusion that the intake of three-winged fruits could improve some rheumatism problems rather than a placebo. These are studies in which two randomly compiled groups either take three-winged fruit remedies or a sham medication. Overall, the results point cautiously in a positive direction. Possibly, the intake of three-winged fruit capsules improves the symptoms of rheumatism more than with placebo.",yes,"We have evaluated two small studies. They suggest that taking trifoliate relieves some rheumatism symptoms better than a placebo remedy. However, these results are not well established."
178,Does thyme strengthen memory or prevent mental decline?,"Whether thyme strengthens memory or prevents dementia is therefore unclear. Despite numerous studies, it has not yet been possible to identify individual measures or means that can demonstrate and significantly reduce the risk of dementia. The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the topic.",unknown,We have not been able to find any studies that have examined this question in the context of human studies.
179,"Does regular consumption of chia seeds reduce body weight, blood sugar levels or cholesterol?","Whether chia seeds can improve health or prevent diseases has been insufficiently researched. They also do not suggest efficacy on individual measurements: the regular consumption of chia seeds should not improve blood fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as blood glucose levels, even after more than five months. Chia seeds should also not have a weight-reducing effect. Thus, dietary supplements with omega-3 fats cannot reduce the risk of premature death due to heart attack, stroke or other diseases.",no,"Whether Chia seeds promote health has not been directly studied. The summarized results of previous studies at least indicate that Chia has no effect on body weight, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. The significance of this"
180,Do heat patches that heat themselves or heat pads help with pain in the neck?,Heat with question mark Whether heat can relieve the pain in the neck is not well researched. We cannot therefore say whether heat in the neck is effective for pain and tension.,unknown,Studies on the pain-relieving effect of heat pads and self-heating plasters are contradictory.
181,Do heat patches containing capsaicin help with neck pain???,The study team reported that people who wear a capsaicin-containing heat patch four weeks a day have just as much (or little) neck pain as people with a placebo patch without an active substance. Further studies with a larger number of participants must confirm whether heat patches with capsaicin are actually ineffective. This indicates that the patches with capsaicin do not have any special analgesic effect.,no,Studies on the pain-relieving effect of heat pads and self-heating plasters are contradictory.
182,Do heat patches help with lower back pain?,"This substance creates a feeling of warmth on the skin, but does not become warm itself. According to their results, it is likely that both types of heat patches can relieve pain in the lower back. Carrying self-warming patches for three days has on average improved the pain in the lower back by 18 points on the 100s scale [1]. In addition to movement exercises or painkillers, the heat patches are probably pain-relieving [1,3].",yes,"Heat patches produce heat by means of a chemical reaction. They can probably relieve low back pain somewhat in the short term. However, this has only been investigated for complaints that have persisted for a maximum of 3 months... Heat patches with chili extract (capsaicin)"
183,Does ginger help with period pain?,"In summary, the best studies currently available indicate that ginger could help [1,2]. In their analyses they came to the same conclusion: The summarized results of the three studies indicate cautiously that ginger capsules can reduce pain by an average of 1.5 points on a scale from 0 to 10 [1,2]. Nevertheless, ginger showed a low pain-relieving effect in all three. In two studies, ginger capsules seemed to have a similar effect to the painkiller mefenamic acid in the 250 mg dose [1].",yes,"Previous studies indicate that ginger can slightly relieve menstrual pain. However, due to deficiencies in their conduct, they are of limited value."
184,"Can the state of health be assessed as reliably with a ""cell check"" analysis as with other diagnostic tests (for example, blood or urine analyses)?","Despite extensive research in five research databases, however, we could not find a single study on the reliability of the cell check method. Thus, the cell check test does not allow ""to create a diagnosis or to make healing statements based on the determined values."" The studies in detail We could not find any studies on the reliability of the cell check method.",unknown,"There are no studies in which the reliability and significance of ""cell check"" results have been verified."
185,Can pain from osteoarthritis (joint wear) be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,"Lubricated joints with hooks We found indications of some effectiveness in the age-related joint wear (arthrosis) in the fingers â€“ in a study [1] with 204 people affected. However, it cannot be derived from how small or large the analgesic effect of Arnika-Gel is for application.",yes,
186,Can pain from a sprained ankle be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,"No confidence in sprains We found a study [2] in which an arnica spray was compared with an active placebo spray to sprained ankles. However, we do not consider the study to be trustworthy, because it is rather inaccurate. In addition, important data are missing. We cannot, therefore, say whether Arnika helps in spraining the ankle. Arnika ineffective against sore muscles?",unknown,
187,Can sore muscles be relieved by arnica ointment or arnica gel?,"Arnika ineffective against sore muscles? There was no noticeable pain-relieving effect in any of them. Since the studies together only had 93 participants, this is not a meaningful result. We cannot therefore safely assume that arnica gels or ointments are really ineffective in case of muscle ache.",no,
188,Can carbon dioxide in mineral water and other sparkling drinks damage teeth or cause tooth decay?,"We were unable to find any studies in which dental health is associated with regular consumption of carbonated beverages. However, clear statements for ""real life"" cannot be derived from these laboratory experiments. The studies in detail During our research in three research databases, we did not find any meaningful studies.",unknown,"Whether the regular consumption of carbonated beverages (mineral water, sparkling soft drinks) damages the teeth more than non-carbonated beverages has not yet been researched."
189,"Does bark extract from maritime pine (also: ""pine bark extract"") improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis?","Unclear: Effect of pine bark extract However, no safe statements can be derived from the existing studies: Because the product with pine bark extract called pycnogenol was examined overall only with relatively few patients. Some of the studies come to contradictory results and have significant methodological shortcomings. Therefore, we cannot assess the importance of pycnogenol in the treatment of osteoarthritis compared to a dummy preparation. However, no statements on possible undesirable effects can be derived from the bark extract.",unknown,"The question was investigated in three smaller studies. However, due to severe methodological deficiencies and partly contradictory results, no firm conclusions can be drawn from them."
190,"Is brown millet effective in favorably influencing the course of the disease in rheumatism (""rheumatoid arthritis"")?","Not a single research project Although we did research in three scientific databases, we could not find a single study on this subject. No research group has yet carried out studies with rheumatoid patients on the effects of brown brains. On this basis, we cannot make any statements about a potential benefit in rheumatism.",unknown,"We could not find any studies on this topic; therefore, statements on the benefits and risks of brown millet in rheumatoid arthritis are not possible."
191,Are cannabis or substances derived from cannabis effective and safe anti-cancer agents?,"However, meaningful work on the anti-cancer effect of the cannabis plant or of individual artificial or natural cannabis substances such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) in humans is unlikely to have been published. It is therefore unclear whether cannabis has an anti-cancer effect. Even a small study [ 1 ] with nine incurable brain tumors did not shed light on the matter.",unknown,Reliable studies on this question are lacking.
192,It is not always possible to reduce elevated cholesterol levels to a healthy level with tablets and thus minimize the risk of heart attack or stroke. Does this succeed through additional injections with PCSK9 antibodies?,"Lower cholesterol What the antibodies can do is lower elevated LDL cholesterol. Accordingly, the antibodies reduce the LDL cholesterol level by almost 60 percent when they are injected in addition to common cholesterol nuclei such as statins or ezetimib [1,10,12]. However, lowering LDL cholesterol does not automatically lead to fewer heart attacks and strokes.",yes,"Up to now, this question has largely been investigated in people who not only have elevated cholesterol levels, but also already suffer from cardiovascular disease. Do these individuals receive additional cholesterol-lowering medications in addition to"
193,Do vaginal suppositories containing the active ingredient imiquimod cause precancerous stages of cervical cancer to recede or disappear?,"It suggests that the method should be effective in principle. After 16 weeks it turned out: With imiquimod, the pre-stages were formed in 73 percent of women in whole or in part.Without the active ingredient, the pre-stages were formed in 39 percent of women in whole or in part. This was similarly common in both groups: with imiquimod, the preliminary stages decreased to CIN 1 grade at 26 percent.Without imiquimod, the preliminary stages decreased to CIN 1 grade at 25 percent.Limited significance The small number of participants reduces the significance of the study.",yes,"In the only study on this subject, treatment was successful in some of those affected. Since the study is flawed and only a few women participated in it, the significance is limited."
194,Is blue light treatment as effective as UV light or other established therapies for psoriasis?,"For some time now, devices have been offered for the so-called ""blue light treatment"" against psoriasis. Extensive comparison missing After our research, we come to the conclusion: Unfortunately, we cannot assess whether the novel blue light therapy really helps people with psoriasis. Without such comparisons, it cannot be seriously estimated whether blue light therapy could play an important role in the treatment of psoriasis in the future. All in all, it is not possible to derive the significance of blue light therapy from the studies found compared to the treatment options available so far.",unknown,"We have not been able to find any publication comparing blue light with established treatments (e.g., UV irradiation)."
195,Does frequent consumption of potatoes increase the risk of dying from cancer?,"Thus, previous studies show no correlation between cancer mortality and potato consumption [1]. Also other causes of death â€“ apart from cancer â€“ did not occur heaped up when participants particularly often ate potatoes [1,2]. Life expectancy and cancer risk also depend on many other things, such as lifestyle, age or income.",no,The summarized results of studies to date do not show an increased risk of fatal cancers. They also do not indicate that potatoes reduce life expectancy overall.
196,Can cancer be detected by dark field analysis (dark field microscopy) of the blood?,"No cancer diagnosis possible We could not find any evidence for these claims â€“ despite extensive search in several research databases. Although twelve of all participants had cancer, the medical practitioner was only right in three. Even if the small number of participants somewhat restricts the significance, the study shows: A cancer ""diagnosis"" with the help of dark field analysis is often wrong and would lead to great uncertainty among those affected.",no,
197,Can dark field analysis indicate other health problems?,"Hardly any studies Questionable is whether other health problems can be identified with the method. Because we could not discover further meaningful studies in which the dark field analysis was compared with recognized diagnostic methods. However, the extent to which the difference is compared to conventional laboratory tests cannot be reliably stated due to numerous problems in the execution of the study.",unknown,
198,Does kombucha have a positive effect on health?,"However, meaningful studies do not seem to have been carried out so far. Neither we nor two other research groups [1,2] could find studies that investigated the effects of Kombucha in humans. At present, therefore, it can neither be proven nor ruled out that Kombucha has a positive impact on health. Despite extensive search in three research databases, we could not find such studies.",unknown,"There are no studies that have conclusively investigated the effect of kombucha in humans. In addition, it is suspected that in rare cases home-made kombucha can lead to liver disease or dangerous hyperacidity of the blood."
199,Is graviola an effective and safe treatment for cancer?,"No evidence of anti-cancer effects We found that there is no serious evidence of such claims. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether or which substances from the Graviola tree could help with cancer. However, laboratory experiments, case reports or reports from folk medicine are by no means evidence that Graviola substances really work against cancer. The studies in detail Graviola has no meaningful studies in which people with a confirmed cancer diagnosis have participated.",unknown,Significant studies with healthy or diseased people are missing so far.
200,Does taking preparations with fenugreek extract improve sex life or satisfaction with it?,"We have not been able to find meaningful studies of the preparation (extract from fenugreek seeds, iron, zinc and vitamin B6) from the reader's request. The benefits or good compatibility of products with extracts of fenugreek seeds cannot therefore be proven with the studies available so far.",unknown,We conclude that no robust conclusions can be drawn from the best available studies to date. We found only two smaller studies with serious methodological flaws. The calculated positive results are not very reliable.
201,Does disulfiram improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy for cancer?,"Practically poorly proven Whether disulfiram actually improves the efficacy or tolerability of chemotherapy, however, is currently unclear. In the second study [2] patients treated with disulfiram in addition to chemotherapy lived for almost three months longer. Whether disulfiram in combination with modern treatment methods would have similar effects is unclear at this stage.",unknown,The question has been investigated in only two older and small studies in people with advanced cancer. The studies have severe methodological flaws and come to contradictory results.
202,Can binaural beats relieve stress or anxiety before surgery and medical treatments?,"The study team could not find differences between the groups in anxiety intensity. In a well done study, we could now assume that binaural beats have no special effect. But the significance of the study is low, and we cannot reliably draw this conclusion.",unknown,"Previous studies are not conclusive. Moreover, their results contradict each other."
203,Is a vegan diet healthier than a vegetarian diet?,"In these studies, both vegan and vegetarian living people were less likely to suffer from cancer. However, whether this also applies to vegan living people is not sufficiently investigated [1]. Without this, it cannot be reliably determined whether vegan is ""the healthier vegetarian."" However, positive health effects beyond those of a vegetarian diet have not been established. For a concrete statement, however, there is no direct comparison between vegan and vegetarian diets.",unknown,There is no evidence that veganism has advantages or disadvantages for health. Both a vegetarian and a vegan diet seem to slightly reduce the risk of cancer compared to mixed diets.
204,Can taking chlorophyll change mouth or body odor?,"There are no meaningful studies of chlorophyll as an antidote to body odor. So the alleged anti-mief effect of chlorophyll has not been seriously researched to this day. Even today, there is no conclusive explanation why chlorophyll should neutralize odors.",unknown,
205,Can taking chlorophyll affect the odor of urine in catheter wearers or stool in people with an artificial bowel outlet?,"According to the nurses, all participants had unpleasant smells of urine. No desired smell In no study was the odour assessment with chlorophyll tablets better than with placebo tablets. However, the small number of participants and weaknesses in the execution of the study limit the significance of the results â€“ therefore it is unlikely that chlorophyll tablets will influence the smell of urine and stools in individuals with urinary catheter or artificial intestinal output in a desired way.",no,
206,Is the risk of bacterial or fungal infection comparable when using menstrual cups or pads?,"The analysis of the solid study with 766 schoolgirls from Westkenia aged 14 to 16 showed that â€“ if certain hygienic standards such as hand washing and keeping the cup clean are adhered to â€“ there are apparently no serious health disadvantages due to infections. Vaginal infections caused by bacteria or fungi did not occur more frequently during the study with a menstrual cup than with conventional disposable binds or even temporary substance deposits. However, there is no evidence that this occurs more frequently with a cup than with tampons or bindings [1]. Cups, tampons and bindings should therefore be more equivalent in terms of leak safety.",yes,Our statement is based on a solid single study. Further studies may provide even more clarity in the future.
207,"Laboratory experiments indicate that leoligin and other substances from edelweiss have a medicinal effect. However, this has not been researched in humans.","However, the results cannot simply be transferred to the human body. Not only the effectiveness of the Edelweiss ingredients is unexplained. The studies in detail Despite intensive search in two research databases, we could not find meaningful studies â€“ i.e.",unknown,"To date, no research has been conducted to determine whether compounds from edelweiss are effective and safe in humans."
208,Can a straight bar improve harmless tension and pain in the neck and back?,"Not checked Unfortunately, despite extensive search we could not find any studies on this. It is therefore unclear whether straight holders can correct the posture and thus relieve pain or tension. In case of neck pain, for which no clear cause can be found, the effectiveness of movement is less well protected.",unknown,"To date, there have been no studies on the efficacy of straight-arm restraints when the pain was not due to serious illness or injury."
209,Are ultrasound examinations during pregnancy safe for the health of the child?,"The result of our research has tended to be calming: Previous studies indicate that ultrasound should not affect the health of the unborn in routine examinations [1-3]. Also for this particular form of ultrasound studies give no indication of harmfulness [1,4,5].The studies in detail In order to investigate possible negative effects of ultrasound examinations, randomized-controlled studies with a large number of female participants are best suited. The summarized results of 16 randomized-controlled studies with around 50,000 pregnant women indicated that ultrasound does not harm the unborn. Restricted expressiveness All in all, based on all the results, we assume that ultrasound examinations should not have any negative consequences in the short or long term.",yes,"In previous studies, routine ultrasound examinations have shown no adverse effects. There were no differences in size, weight, birth complications or malformations in the neonatal period. Later, there were no differences between more frequently or less frequently ""sonicated"" children with respect to development or skills such as reading, speech, arithmetic, vision, or hearing. However, deficiencies in the study conduct limit the validity of these results quite severely."
210,Can oregano oil relieve discomfort or disease?,"We could only include one study in our evaluation, but it is not meaningful. Therefore, we do not know whether oregano oil can relieve or cure any discomfort and disease in humans. We can therefore neither deny nor affirm the question of the health effects of oregano oil. So whether oregano oil promotes health is unexplained.",unknown,"So far, there are no conclusive studies that have investigated the health-promoting effects of oregano oil. We do not know, for example, whether it helps against infections."
211,Are Bach flower remedies effective in helping with test anxiety?,"We did not find many studies in particular, but we were able to include the three best available works with a total of 272 participants in our evaluation: In summary [ 1 ] these works [ 2,3,4 ] indicate that Bach flowers do not help against examination anxiety, at least not better than a placebo agent. According to this, Bach flowers should not help against exam anxiety, at least not better than a placebo drug. In all three studies [ 2,3,4 ], there were no significant differences between the Bach Blossom group and the placebo group at the end of the study. In the case of well-made studies, one could reasonably reliably conclude that Bach flower remedies do not work against examination anxiety. However, since two of the three studies have grosser shortcomings, the overall result is uncertain.",no,Three small studies indicate that remedies with Bach flowers against test anxiety do not help better than a placebo.
212,Can capsules with diamine oxidase alleviate or prevent symptoms of histamine intolerance?,Whether capsules with diamine oxidase can help with histamine intolerance is therefore neither proven nor excluded. Difficult diagnosis Not only is it unclear whether the intake of diamine oxidase is effective.,unknown,We found only one small study with insufficient power.
213,Does magnesium help with period pain?,"Whether the intake of magnesium can relieve regular pain can therefore neither be seriously affirmed nor denied from our point of view. The effect of magnesium alone has not been studied. Without this information, we cannot assess how well the magnesium might have helped. However, the results are not meaningful.",unknown,"To date, there have been no meaningful studies examining this."
214,"Does cannabis improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease, for example movement disorders?","Also in the other study [2] cannabis could not relieve various Parkinson's typical movement disorders, such as walking or getting up, better than the placebo agent. So whether cannabis is useful in Parkinson's is unexplained. Due to the low number of participants, it is not certain how well people can tolerate Parkinson's cannabis. Therefore, we need to look at the results with great caution. Thus, the significance of the investigations is quite limited.",unknown,"The question has been investigated in only two small studies of unclear methodological quality. While they do not suggest any positive effects on different movement disorders, one study gives evidence of a small improvement in quality of life."
215,Is the dietary supplement nattokinase effective and safe as a blood thinner?,"Unfortunately, our research has not revealed meaningful studies with risk persons who have taken nattokinase in the longer term. Therefore, we cannot say whether nattokinase works as a blood thinner in people at risk and the occurrence of severe cardiovascular disease (e.g. The studies in detail We could not find any meaningful studies with which the effect of nattokinase on blood dilution and the protective effect on cardiovascular diseases could be assessed.",unknown,"We could not find any conclusive studies on this issue. Therefore, it remains unclear whether nattokinase acts as a blood thinner and consequently prevents severe cardiovascular disease. Likewise, we do not know whether taking the enzyme is safe."
216,"Is the Feldenkrais Method effective against pain and tension in the neck, shoulders and back?","Therefore, we cannot confirm or exclude whether Feldenkrais is an effective method for pain. There is no scientific confirmation of the effectiveness of Feldenkrais so far. Whether strengthening exercise is effective in neck pain is not well studied. They were unable to answer our question about the effectiveness of the Feldenkrais method due to its low significance. However, due to the deficiencies and the small number of test subjects, it cannot be concluded that the combination of Feldenkrais and Virtual Reality program has a similar effect to movement exercises.",unknown,Studies conducted to date are too untrustworthy to answer this question.
217,Does an alkaline bath help with neurodermatitis?,"However, despite extensive research in several research databases, we could not find a single meaningful study. Whether a base bath can help with neurodermatitis never seems to have been investigated. Thus, we could not find any indication that basic cosmetics alleviate symptoms of neurodermatitis. However, there are no meaningful studies comparing the effect of low and high pH care products [1].",unknown,"To date, there is no meaningful research on this."
218,"Does birch water, also called birch sap, help with health problems?","However, without success: We could not find a single study in which health effects of birch water were the subject. However, the experiments do not give any concrete indication of the allegedly anti-inflammatory effect of birch water. No studies in humans But even if an efficacy could have been demonstrated in experimental animals or in cells in the test tube, this would not be proof for a long time that humans also benefit from birch water. But because high-quality studies are missing, it is not possible to say whether birch water could be harmful for some people. The studies in detail There are no studies that have investigated the effect of birch water on human health.",unknown,"So far, there are no studies that have investigated this issue. Therefore, evidence for the effectiveness of birch water is lacking. The side effects have also not been researched."
219,Is oolong tea an effective way to lose weight?,"However, we could not find any meaningful studies on this issue. However, we could not make any statements about health-enhancing weight loss in overweight people. The studies in detail We have not found any meaningful studies.",unknown,"We have not found any studies on the subject. Therefore, we cannot judge whether commercial oolong tea helps overweight people reduce their weight."
220,"Do Waveex and similar products reduce exposure to electromagnetic fields, for example when using a cell phone or smartphone?","Waveex: The evidence is missing During extensive research in two large databases for medical publications, we did not find a single study on stickers such as Waveex or other similar products. However, the way the data has been evaluated cannot answer whether the sticker has the claimed effect: The research team has not investigated whether the pulse frequency varies between phone calls with and without Waveex stickers. However, for none of these claims there are evidence or studies that have investigated this. However, the study cannot show that this affects the health of the subjects. Reducing radiation without stickers There are some measures that can easily and scientifically reduce radiation exposure when making calls â€“ without Gabriel chip and Waveex stickers [2] [6].",unknown,The alleged active principle of Waveex and other comparable products is not scientifically plausible. We also found no meaningful study that could provide information about a possible effect of the cell phone stickers.
221,Can ingredients in deodorants like aluminum salts cause breast cancer?,"In any case, in the course of our extensive literature search in medical databases, we could not find any methodologically valuable meaningful studies that establish a definite connection between the use of deodorants and breast cancer. However, there are currently no studies or other evidence suggesting a risk of parabens or a connection with the development of breast cancer. The fact that higher aluminium concentrations have been found in cancer samples does not yet prove that aluminium has contributed to the development of cancer. Even if the deodorants are actually co-causers of breast cancer diseases, it is not possible to assess which deodorants should have led to this examination. For this reason, we do not believe that the results of this study prove that Deos cause or do not cause breast cancer.",unknown,Whether the long-term use of deodorants can lead to breast cancer has not been sufficiently researched. There is a lack of studies conducted according to strict criteria with people over a longer period of time.
222,"Does the intake of black cumin improve the symptoms of asthma, e.g. shortness of breath?","Little persuasive As we found out, the data on black cumin in asthma is very thin: we found only four smaller studies [1-4]. However, there was no overall convincing effect of black cumin on asthma: three studies [1-3] reported a positive result in the publications, one study [4] found no effect. In the two studies, which seem to us to be the most reliable method [2,3], the measured improvements are so small that they are probably not noticeable for people with asthma. In the other study [3], it is not possible to determine exactly whether the three events described (stomach problems, headaches, sleep disorders) have occurred with black cumin or the dummy medication. Statements about the effects of prolonged use of black cumin cannot be made with this.",unknown,The question has been investigated in four small studies. Some of them have serious methodological flaws and come to contradictory results.
223,Do specially trained dogs reliably warn of dangerous hypoglycemia?,"how often the diabetic warning dogs are correct â€“ but these studies are very small and they also have other methodological limitations such as the lack of comparison with the already established and best available methods. Therefore, we cannot derive many crucial facts from these publications: For example, how often diabetic warning dogs under real everyday conditions ""recognize or miss a hypoglycaemic, from which values they react or when they strike false alarms. The studies in detail We have not found any studies on the basis of which solid statements can be made on how reliable diabetic warning dogs warn compared to established methods in a hypoglycaemic, from which blood sugar low they attack and how many emergencies can be prevented.",unknown,"There are some positive reports and pilot studies. However, larger, well-done studies are lacking. Therefore, it is not proven whether or which dogs reliably detect and report threatening low blood glucose levels. Also unclear: how often do diabetic alert dogs give false alarms?"
224,Does taking proton pump inhibitors (PPI) increase the risk of bone fractures?,"According to you, with increasing duration of treatment and at higher doses, the risk of fractures may increase slightly. However, it is not possible to say exactly how many bone fractures actually go into the PPI's account.",yes,"The question has been investigated in many observational studies involving a total of around 800,000 people. These show indications that prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors may result in more bone fractures. However, it is not possible to quantify exactly how great the risk of PPI is. Presumably, the likelihood of bone fractures increases with longer use and higher dosage."
225,Can matrix therapy (also: matrix rhythm therapy) alleviate complaints of muscles and joints?,"So we don't know if matrix therapy can help people with chronic cross pain [1], painful shoulder stiffness (Frozen Shoulder) [2] or pain in the upper back or neck area [3]. However, there is no evidence for the claims that can be read on the websites of two matrix therapy providers: As a result, all body cells vibrate in a certain rhythm. Neither immediately after the end of treatment nor after 24 weeks there was any benefit for matrix therapy. It is therefore unclear whether matrix therapy can improve the symptoms that would not have occurred without matrix therapy.",unknown,Studies conducted to date are too deficient to answer this question.
226,Can hyposensitization by injections with allergy-causing pollen components help with hay fever?,"Moderate improvement In fact, the summarized results of previous studies show that hyposensitization with syringes lasting up to two years can in principle alleviate hay fever complaints. In principle, the results indicate that with the help of a syringe cure, the symptoms become less during the hyposensitization period. For those who had actually received a ""real"" injection, the allergy symptoms improved significantly.",yes,"In the case of hay fever, hyposensitization with injections can probably alleviate the symptoms somewhat. However, there is still too little research on how long this effect lasts."
227,Can hyposensitization by means of drops or tablets administered under the tongue help with hay fever?,Moderate relief without guarantee of success The summarized results of previous studies show that hyposensitization by means of pollen extracts taken under the tongue probably alleviates the symptoms somewhat [1].,yes,"Probably this form of hyposensitization helps to alleviate hay fever symptoms somewhat, but the effect is unlikely to be great."
228,Do Blushwood berries help against skin cancer?,"No published data on skin cancer study As promising as these results seem, no reliable conclusions on human efficacy can be derived from cell and animal experiments alone. However, the results of the study have not yet been published scientifically.",unknown,"An active ingredient (EBC-46, tigilanol tiglate) isolated from blushwood berries is currently being studied. Results of an initial study with people who have cancer have not yet been published. We have not been able to identify studies of an anti-cancer effect of other extracts from the berries that are ingested."
229,Can relaxation exercises and a reduction in stress slow the progression of glaucoma?,"We did not find any meaningful research in it. Due to the poor study quality, however, an effect can neither be excluded nor proven. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed or ruled out whether relaxation exercises can help glaucoma sufferers. Moreover, no study has examined the most important question: whether relaxation exercises slow down the progression of glaucoma. However, due to several shortcomings, this result is not meaningful either.",unknown,Studies to date are too deficient to answer this question.
230,Can dementia be prevented by years of orange juice consumption?,"It is therefore not entirely clear whether the positive result may be merely a coincidence. In this study, a benefit of oranges and orange juice could not be clearly demonstrated. Therefore, according to the current state of science, whether the regular consumption of orange juice can actually prevent dementia remains unclear.",unknown,"The protective effect of orange juice on mental performance has been investigated in two large studies over several years. However, changes in mental performance are not the same as a dementia diagnosis. In addition: the studies came to different results, and chance findings cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the question cannot be answered."
231,Can remedies from papaya improve digestion or relieve gastrointestinal discomfort?,"Studies without meaningfulness To this end, we searched medical databases after studies with people who suffered from digestive problems or gastrointestinal complaints and tried papayas or other diseases. Many data are missing We cannot understand this conclusion because we lack important information. We could not find studies on other papaya products or papaya fruit without further processing. Overall, the evaluation is incomplete and incomprehensible. For us, it is not a basis for any conclusions as to whether papayas or papayas should be considered.",unknown,Studies to date are too deficient to provide a meaningful answer to this question.
232,"Are kinesiotapes effective for chronic non-specific lower back pain (""low back pain"")?","No improvement, much uncertainty Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it. It concludes that kinesiotaping may not have the expected pain-relieving effect on the lower back area. Two studies [4-6] did not show any improvement that significantly exceeded the placebo effect. Thus, overall, kinesiotaping does not cause pain relief in chronic cross pain.",no,"The efficacy of kinesiotaping in relation to non-specific chronic low back pain (""low back pain"") has been investigated in only a few studies. Overall, the evidence suggests that pain intensity does not decrease with kinesiotapes any more than with a placebo tape; thus, the tapes may not be effective. However, this preliminary finding is not well supported. This is because the best studies currently available do not compare well, most lasted only four weeks, and had few subjects overall."
233,Does early detection of lung cancer by trained sniffer dogs provide significant benefits to those affected?,"Extensive practical tests are missing However, these studies cannot answer how reliable this recognition works on a larger scale in practice â€“ for example in a lung clinic or a special test operation. There is also a lack of direct comparison of sight dogs with other early detection methods, especially low-dose computer tomography (CT) in the studies we evaluate.",unknown,"Experiments indicate that some dogs can detect lung cancer from human breath samples. But we cannot say whether screening with specially trained dogs provides tangible benefits to those affected, such as preventing deaths or enabling gentler treatment."
234,Do snoring sprays or gargle solutions help against snoring?,"However, we could not specifically identify any studies on this snarch spray and therefore could not make an assessment. The significance is very modest, the results are contradictory: in two studies [1,2] there was no difference between the tested products and a dummy preparation. Since the studies lasted for a maximum of two weeks, no reliable statements can be made about long-term effects or adverse effects on permanent use. Therefore, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions for permanent use.",unknown,Three smaller studies with methodological flaws come to contradictory conclusions.
235,Does Maca help with sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction or sexual aversion in men and women?,"However, these studies have been poorly carried out and are therefore not meaningful. In other words, we don't know if Maca means can help men with erectile dysfunction or women with sexual problems. It is also unclear how Maca increases libido in men with good sexual health. However, their results are not clear and untrustworthy [1-3]. Therefore, the effect of Maca remains questionable [1,4].",unknown,Studies to date are too deficient to provide a meaningful answer to this question.
236,Can glacier milk powder prevent hangover or relieve hangover symptoms?,Neither in animals nor in the laboratory have such rock powders been studied â€“ and certainly not in solid studies with human subjects. It is therefore not possible to answer whether the product is effective. The studies in detail There are no studies that have investigated the effect of glacial milk powder (fine ground rock) on hangover complaints.,unknown,"To date, there are no studies that have investigated this issue. There is no evidence of efficacy; side effects have also not been studied."
237,Can ingredients from pomegranate lower elevated blood pressure or reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"The results are contradictory. The work lacked due diligence in its implementation, and they lack essential standards for trustworthy scientific investigations. So there is currently no evidence of a blood pressure lowering effect of pomegranate. Much unclear Whether the regular consumption of pomegranates in the form of nuclei, pulp, juices or the intake of appropriate dietary supplements actually lowers an increased blood pressure, can not be proven or excluded at present. However, the studies provided an overall unclear picture, since the individual results contradict each other.",unknown,Previous studies are poor and not conclusive enough to answer this question.
238,Does regular consumption of red meat or processed meat products increase the risk of colorectal cancer?,"Risk slightly increased It is indeed likely that a meat-rich diet increases the risk of colon cancer. People who had regularly eaten a lot of meat in these studies were slightly more likely to suffer from colorectal cancer than those who had little meat on their diet. As a result, the risk of cancer increases by 12 percent with each daily extra portion of 100 grams of red meat (beef, pig, lamb, goat, game) [1]. There are also other possible explanations for the fact that more frequent consumption of meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. It was clear that the risk of colorectal cancer increases with the amount of meat consumed.",yes,"People who regularly eat a lot of red meat or processed meat products such as sausage, ham and bacon are likely to have a slightly higher risk of colorectal cancer than people who eat little meat."
239,Does stool transplantation help with ulcerative colitis?,"Possibly effective in ulcerative colitis A research group from the independent science network Cochrane wanted to know whether faeces transplantation can help with intestinal diseases. The result of her analysis is encouraging: at least with ulcerative colitis, a stool transplant could help [1].",yes,"In ulcerative colitis, stool transplantation could reduce symptoms for at least 8 weeks. Whether the method also helps in the long term has not been sufficiently researched. We have not found any conclusive studies on Crohn's disease."
240,Does stool transplantation help in Crohn's disease???,It is also unclear whether a stool transplant can also help in the long term. No studies on Crohn's disease Whether a stool transplant can also help with Crohn's disease is unclear. A response could be provided by two ongoing studies to patients with Crohn's disease for whom there are no final results [1].,unknown,"In ulcerative colitis, stool transplantation could reduce symptoms for at least 8 weeks. Whether the method also helps in the long term has not been sufficiently researched. We have not found any conclusive studies on Crohn's disease."
241,"Can remedies from the iambul tree improve blood glucose control in diabetes or precursors of diabetes (""pre-diabetes"")?","Already in advance: these studies could not convince us of any benefit. On this basis, we cannot confirm or exclude that means derived from the Jambul tree are effective and safe â€“ this applies to all groups of people in question, i.e., people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and people with a pre-stage of diabetes. Thus, in our assessment, it is unclear whether the investigations are comparable and to what extent the results can be transferred to Jambul tree remedies from other parts of the plant and with other forms of preparation. Various contradictions The four studies also come to contradictory results: In two investigations [1,2], the herbal preparation is significantly inferior compared to established diabetes drugs. Given the low number of participants and the relatively short duration of treatment, it is not possible to evaluate the compatibility of Jambul tree products on the basis of these data â€“ just as we could not draw any conclusions on effectiveness.",unknown,"We were able to identify four studies that investigated the benefit of preparations from the iambul tree ( Syzygium cumini ) in people with diabetes. Because the studies are very small, had very few participants, and are partially contradictory, no firm conclusions can be drawn."
242,Does HPV vaccination reduce the risk of cervical cancer in girls?,"According to the results, HPV vaccination reduces the risk of abnormal tissue changes (""dysplasia"") on the cervix, which may later lead to cancer. However, the results suggest that HPV vaccination will reduce the risk of cancer in the long term. Early detection useful despite vaccination HPV vaccination is likely to reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer. However, the results suggest that HPV vaccination will reduce the risk of cervical cancer.",yes,"HPV vaccination reduces the risk of abnormal tissue changes (of grade CIN2 and higher) on the cervix, which can later develop into cancer. Thus, the risk of later developing cervical cancer probably also decreases. However, the vaccination does not provide complete protection because it is not effective against all cancer-causing human papilloma viruses (HPV)."
243,Is stool transplantation effective against recurrent Clostridium difficile infections ?,"Nevertheless, their results carefully make hope. The summary analysis of the three studies suggests that faecal transplantation may be more likely to improve diarrhoea by clostridium difficile than vancomycin [4].",yes,"So far, only a few studies have been conducted with humans. These have various shortcomings. Nevertheless, there is evidence that stool transplantation is effective."
244,Does the juice of the aronia berry help against cystitis?,"Our conclusion after the literature research: We could only find one study [1] on the topic, whose results are however not meaningful. We cannot therefore assess whether aronia berry juice has a preventive effect. Therefore, it is not possible to say whether these household remedies are really effective or how well they help â€“ even if some people swear to do so [3.6].",unknown,"The aronia berry is said to have various positive effects. For example, its juice is said to have a preventive effect against bladder infections. However, we could not find any conclusive studies on this topic."
245,Is Intermittent Fasting suitable for reducing excess weight as well as a conventional low calorie diet?,"Effective as long-term diet According to this, interval fasting is probably effective in reducing body weight in overweight and obese adults. How well interval fasting works over a longer period of time (more than a year) and what undesirable effects it can have â€“ unfortunately, this is hardly researched at all. The studies in detail Our research has shown that intermittent fasting (also: intermittent fasting) is likely to be effective for weight loss in overweight or obese people.",yes,"Intermittent fasting (also: intermittent fasting) is probably effective for losing weight. In terms of weight reduction, there are probably no clear differences from a conventional diet in which calories are permanently reduced. Both paths can lead to weight reductions that are significant for health. The current assessment is based mainly on studies over a maximum of 12 months with middle-aged women from affluent countries. Long-term effects and adverse effects of intermittent fasting still need to be better studied."
246,"Is the risk for the brain inflammation SSPE as a consequence of measles disease greater than long assumed? That is, out of every 100,000 people infected with measles, does more than one person develop SSPE (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis) later in life?","According to more recent estimates, of 10,000 measles sufferers after a survived infection, one to two people in later life appear to receive SSPE [7,8]. Risk assessment for late consequences apparently outdated Our conclusion on the topic after the evaluation of previous studies with data from Germany, Great Britain and the USA [1-3] : Measles can have severe complications; among them late consequences such as the rare, ultimately fatal brain inflammation SPE. The actual SSPE risk appears to be significantly higher, especially for measles-infected babies and toddlers. On this basis, they estimated that 1 out of 609 babies (under 12 months) will later develop SSPE with measles. All studies indicate a higher risk than the probably outdated estimate of 1:100.000 [3].",yes,"The risk for the fatal brain infection SSPE appears to be significantly higher than the estimate of one SSPE case per 100,000 measles cases in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. To calculate the risk more accurately, more reliable long-term recording of measles infections and SSPE cases would be needed."
247,Can acupuncture for labor induction trigger the onset of labor?,"The summarized results show that acupuncture is unlikely to be effective in initiating a birth. As a result, women â€“ whether with or without acupuncture â€“ are similarly frequently employed in labor and other established birth initiation measures. The summary analysis of the two studies suggests that acupuncture may not significantly shorten the duration of birth. According to the results of three studies [2.5.6] on a total of 817 women, it is likely that pregnant women with both real and sham acupuncture will need oxytocin as a labor-promoting agent. In sum, the results of both studies do not indicate that acupuncture could shorten the duration of the birth.",no,The results of previous studies suggest that acupuncture is not effective for induction of labor.
248,Can switching to a higher fiber diet prevent colorectal cancer?,"The fiber-rich diet therefore does not seem to have reduced the risk of polyps. The risk of colorectal cancer does not seem to decrease due to a few years of fiber-rich diet. The mathematical summary (metaanalysis) of the five studies therefore gives no indication that fiber can prevent intestinal polyps or cancer. With a total of 23 people affected, however, the number of colorectal cancer cases in the studies is too small to exclude a random result The results are therefore no evidence that fiber increases the risk of cancer.",no,"According to previous studies, regular intake of wheat bran or psyllium husks over a period of up to four years does not appear to be able to reduce the risk of colorectal precancer and colorectal cancer. This also applies to a comprehensive change to a high-fiber diet."
249,Can perineal massage during pregnancy help prevent birth injury in first-time mothers?,"Some First Bearers Benefit According to these studies [1,2], women who massage their dam before birth for prevention are likely to have a slightly lower risk of certain birth injuries. According to this, some women who give birth to vaginally for the first time can probably benefit from a dam massage â€“ which is probably due to a little less injuries. These points limit our confidence in the results. Nevertheless, the team of authors identified a similar trend as the large survey work [1] : According to this, the prenatal dam massage should reduce the number of dam cuts and other injuries in first births.",yes,The study evidence to date shows that perineal birth injuries are likely to be somewhat reduced in the group of women having a baby for the first time. This is due in particular to the fact that fewer perineal incisions were performed. The positive effect could not be shown for women who had already had a vaginal delivery.
250,Can cancer be effectively treated with vitamin C infusions?,"Overall, the study shows that swallowing high doses of vitamin C probably does not help in cancer. Instead, infusions are indicated â€“ the aim is to achieve a higher concentration of vitamin in the blood and cancer tissue than is possible by swallowing vitamin C. However, the fact that higher levels of vitamin C blood can effectively combat cancer is mere theory. It is therefore impossible to answer whether vitamin C infusions promote the healing of cancer. However, it could not provide evidence of this, because important data are missing. Overall, we conclude from the study that the intake of vitamin C in the form of preparations that are swallowed is probably ineffective for the treatment of cancer.",unknown,Studies conducted to date are deficient and inconclusive.
251,Are detox cures good for health?,"We have not found any studies that demonstrate a health benefit of detox cures. However, there is no scientific evidence that Detox can help here.",unknown,"The term ""detox"" is not clearly defined. Therefore, we did not find any studies that investigated a health effect."
252,Do sweeteners increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or sugar metabolism disorders?,"Unfortunately, no clear statement In most of the studies we analysed, although there was a possible link between the consumption of sweeteners and an increased risk of diabetes. Our conclusion is therefore that sweeteners increase the risk for type 2 diabetes, can neither be proven nor excluded on the basis of the current state of science.",unknown,"The question has been investigated in several large population studies with long observation periods. Nevertheless, no clear conclusion can be drawn: the best estimates cautiously suggest a small effect. However, it could easily be due to other influences. Another problem is that most of the studies only examined sodas and other beverages containing sweeteners. Reliable information on quantity, sweetener type and foods containing sweeteners is lacking."
253,Does flu vaccination reduce the likelihood of getting the flu (influenza)?,"Influenza vaccination can also reduce the risk of becoming ill. Race with the virus In the influenza vaccine there are inactivated influenza viruses or parts of the virus cover. The results are sobering, a vaccination can probably only prevent 60 percent of the flu diseases. However, influenza vaccination may reduce the risk of disease by more than half. In fact, it is only poorly investigated how well the flu vaccination protects.",yes,"Flu vaccination is likely to protect adults from influenza. In studies on this, 2.3 percent of participants fell ill without vaccination. With vaccination, the figure was 0.9 percent."
254,Can therapy with the radioactive gas radon noticeably alleviate pain in rheumatism-related joint inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis)?,A cure with radon does not seem to be able to relieve joint pain in rheumatism so well that the symptoms improve noticeably. From this we conclude that a radon cure can probably not improve joint pain in rheumatism.,no,"In two small studies, a course of radon therapy relieved pain so slightly within six months that the effect was probably not noticeable."
255,Does frankincense help with painful joint wear (osteoarthritis)?,"Their results are cautiously optimistic: Incense could relieve pain in worn joints and possibly improve restrictions in everyday life. Similar results, but a lot of criticism The results of the four studies show all in the direction of pain relief and improvement of the restriction in everyday life.",yes,"Taking frankincense capsules may improve joint pain somewhat. However, this still needs to be confirmed by larger, better conducted studies."
256,"Does the extract of the plant Salacia reticulata in combination with vitamin D (""Exadipin"") help to lose weight?","However, the result is disappointing: Whether the product helps with weight loss has never been investigated in meaningful studies. Whether the combination of salacia and vitamin D, distributed under the name ""Exadipin"" helps with weight loss, is thus not sufficiently researched. The studies in detail If a combination of the extract of Salacia reticulata and vitamin D helps with weight loss, two small controlled studies have so far investigated [1,2]. Again, the observation period of 12 weeks is too short to assess whether exadipine helps with weight loss or not.",unknown,There are no conclusive studies that have investigated this effect.
257,Does yoga reduce the impairment in everyday life caused by persistent (chronic) back pain?,"A little less problems in everyday life According to our research of the best available studies, we assume that regular yoga exercises are likely to help in chronic back pain. This means that yoga may make a small noticeable difference. In their analyses, the two research groups largely agree: regular yoga exercises made the participants feel less affected by their back pain after six months in everyday life.",yes,"With yoga, after six months, sufferers are likely to feel somewhat less affected by their back pain and be able to ""function"" better in everyday life. However, it seems that the pain itself is not noticeably weakened by the yoga sessions."
258,Does yoga alleviate the severity of persistent back pain???,"In contrast, if it may sound contradictory, the pain does not seem to improve noticeably. Although the patients reported improvements in everyday life, on the other hand, there was no overall evidence that the pain improved [1,2]. The pain itself, however, does not seem to diminish noticeably through yoga.",no,"With yoga, after six months, sufferers are likely to feel somewhat less affected by their back pain and be able to ""function"" better in everyday life. However, it seems that the pain itself is not noticeably weakened by the yoga sessions."
259,Do laughter yoga or laughter therapy have positive health effects?,"Therefore, we do not trust the results and there needs to be much better work on effects and side effects. Contrary to the statements of the author's teams, we are by no means convinced that salmon therapy is helpful, for example, against depression, anxiety and stress or mental well-being, self-esteem, sleep and thinking ability.",unknown,"There are some studies on the subject. But these are unfortunately not conclusive. After evaluating five smaller studies, we can therefore neither speak for nor against the existence of a positive health effect of laughter yoga or laughter therapy."
260,Can a height-adjustable desk reduce sitting time in the office?,"From the evaluation of after all ten studies it can be concluded that with such tables the daily sitting time in the office may be reduced. The participants with seat-stand table sat by an average of 100 minutes less per working day than people with conventional seating tables. Height-adjustable desks might be effective for people who could use height-adjustable desks, reducing their daily sitting during work by an average of 84 to 116 minutes. The test persons working on height-adjustable desks also tended to sit a little less in their spare time. Overall, the results on the effectiveness of height-adjustable tables to reduce work-related sitting time should be enjoyed with some caution.",yes,There is evidence that people with height-adjustable desks could reduce sitting by about 100 minutes per workday in the short term. Whether the effect lasts in the long term has not been studied. We have separately researched the extent to which a reduction in sitting time can contribute to better health.
261,Does a diet that includes as many organic foods as possible lower the risk of cancer?,"Both studies can neither prove nor refute that organic foods protect against cancer. Furthermore, the authors cannot rule out that there is another explanation for the lower risk of cancer in the French study: for example, it could also be that the proponents of bio-foods have reduced the likelihood of cancer for quite different reasons, for example through factors such as income, education or access to the health system. Overall, it remains questionable whether a diet with a high proportion of organic food can reduce the risk of cancer. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the slightly lower number of cancer cases in the French study was really due to the diet with more organic food. Conclusion Overall, all data can neither prove nor refute the established thesis.",unknown,"To date, only two studies have been published that have explored a possible link between the consumption of organic products and cancer risk. Both publications have methodological flaws. Moreover, they contradict each other: One suggests that people with higher organic consumption are less likely to develop cancer, while the second study found no differences between organic and conventional diets."
262,Does cinnamon lower blood sugar levels in diabetes?,"Their summarized results are disappointing: Cinnamon can probably not influence, therefore, the blood sugar level of diabetes sufferers in a favorable way. Overall, blood glucose levels did not differ between the two groups at the end of the study. A longer-term effect of cinnamon â€“ for example, on health consequences of diabetes â€“ has not yet been investigated.",no,The pooled results of studies to date indicate that cinnamon is unlikely to affect blood glucose levels in diabetic patients.
263,Does sitting for long periods shorten the lifespan?,"The summarized results of these studies seem to confirm the fears: the people studied lived shorter when they spent a lot of time sitting [1,2]. According to this study, in an average period of about eight years, 7 out of 100 people who had spent less than 9 hours a day sitting died 10 out of 100 people who had spent 10 hours a day sitting. However, the studies have one thing in common with both types of survey: they suggest that the more time you spend sitting each day, the more likely you will be to die early. Thus, long sitting, regardless of age, overweight, smoking or alcohol consumption, seems to shorten your life.",yes,"According to the summarized results of previous studies, people live shorter if they sit for nine hours or per day. However, it is not well established that sitting for long periods is really to blame for premature deaths."
264,Does mammography screening reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer in certain age groups?,"Participation in mammography screening is likely to reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer in women at an average risk. For women aged 50 and over, participation in mammography screening reduced the risk of more advanced breast cancer, but not for younger women.",yes,"According to a large systematic review, participation in mammography screening in women between 50 and 69 is likely to prevent a few deaths from breast cancer. Whether mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality in women younger than 50 years has not been proven with certainty."
265,"Should wisdom teeth that have not or not completely grown out of the jaw and gums be removed as a precaution? Even if the ""impacted"" teeth are not causing any symptoms at the moment and no pathological changes are to be expected immediately?","Because these partly have serious defects, it remains unclear whether caries, inflammations (parodontitis) and misalignments of other teeth can be influenced by the precautionary removal of wisdom teeth. Overall, therefore, the study situation is insufficient and dental research can so far give no answer to whether symptom-free retinated wisdom teeth should be removed or left in the mouth. Therefore, we do not know whether it makes sense to remove non-complaint-free retinated wisdom teeth in the sense of precaution by means of routine surgery, in order to avoid later problems for example with caries or misalignments.",unknown,"According to current knowledge, there is no answer as to whether the precautionary removal of impacted wisdom teeth helps to prevent problems later in life. It is therefore unclear how to deal with these last molars if they do not protrude or only partially protrude from the jaw and gums, are free of signs of disease and do not damage neighboring teeth."
266,"Do turmeric preparations alleviate the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis (""joint wear"") better than a placebo?","Despite the impressive number of participants, no clear statements on the benefit of turmeric in knee arthritis can be derived from the studies. Our conclusion: no statement possible Whether turmeric in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis really helps (or not), we cannot say reliably. For these reasons, we cannot make a reliable statement for the benefit of turmeric preparations in the case of osteoarthritis.",unknown,"Effects of turmeric on pain and mobility have been investigated in several small studies. However, these had few test subjects, poor methodological quality and varied results. Therefore, no reliable statements can be made.,We cannot make any reliable assessment of the efficacy of turmeric against pain and for improving mobility. This is because the question was only investigated in two very small studies, the methodological quality of which leaves much to be desired."
267,"Do turmeric preparations relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (""rheumatism"") better than a placebo or painkiller???","Our conclusion: no statement possible Whether turmeric in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis really helps (or not), we cannot say reliably. Furthermore, as very few patients have been studied, we cannot safely assess the efficacy of turmeric in rheumatoid arthritis.",unknown,"Effects of turmeric on pain and mobility have been investigated in several small studies. However, these had few test subjects, poor methodological quality and varied results. Therefore, no reliable statements can be made.,We cannot make any reliable assessment of the efficacy of turmeric against pain and for improving mobility. This is because the question was only investigated in two very small studies, the methodological quality of which leaves much to be desired."
268,Does the intake of omega-3 fatty acids improve the clinical picture in multiple sclerosis (MS) or does this inhibit progression of the disease?,"However, we could not find convincing evidence of a benefit of omega-3 fatty acids in MS. In most diet changes, no success could be observed anyway.",no,"Studies with a total of over 1000 participants found predominantly no benefit from omega-3 fatty acids. However, the studies investigated very different preparations and in some cases showed methodological deficiencies.,For the intake of vitamin A or certain diets, we found only one (relatively) small study with serious methodological deficiencies in each case. They reported either no benefit or effects of questionable significance for the people concerned."
269,Does taking vitamin A or following certain diets improve or halt the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS)?,So we can't say whether the use of vitamin A or the diets mentioned above is effective to influence MS favorably.,unknown,"Studies with a total of over 1000 participants found predominantly no benefit from omega-3 fatty acids. However, the studies investigated very different preparations and in some cases showed methodological deficiencies.,For the intake of vitamin A or certain diets, we found only one (relatively) small study with serious methodological deficiencies in each case. They reported either no benefit or effects of questionable significance for the people concerned."
270,Can Botox injections prevent migraine attacks?,"Botox â€“ no great help According to studies carried out so far, syringe treatment with Botox is likely to help. This means that with Botox the migraine is not left out, the number of seizures is only reduced a little. Overall, Botox seems to be able to reduce the number of monthly migraine days by an average of two days.",yes,"According to studies to date, Botox seems to reduce the number of migraine days by two days per month. However, this only applies to severely affected patients who suffer from headaches for more than two weeks a month."
271,Does taking probiotics facilitate weight loss to any significant degree?,"Whether probiotics help normal weights to get the desired bikini figure, can therefore not be said from the studies. The two more recent studies [5.6] do not show any difference between the use of the probiotic and the placebo.",no,"The question has been investigated in a large number of studies. In summary, there is at most a small benefit over a maximum period of half a year, but this is probably not significant. Longer-term effects have not been investigated. Due to methodological shortcomings of most studies, no firm conclusions can be drawn."
272,Does the full moon have a negative effect on sleep duration?,"The summarized results of these studies suggest that people do not sleep shorter in nights around full moon than around new moon [1-7]. We therefore do not consider the difference to be significant; therefore, the full moon does not seem to shorten the duration of sleep. The comparison across all studies shows no difference between full moon nights and new moon nights. The test subjects did not sleep longer or shorter around the full moon.",no,"Some studies can be found that have investigated the influence of the moon on sleep. However, they are not very conclusive. In sum, they do not indicate that people sleep shorter on nights around the full moon than around the new moon."
273,Can lemon juice prevent or effectively treat gastrointestinal illness caused by norovirus?,"Thus, there is no evidence that lemon juice protects against contagion with noroviruses. Whether lemon juice does not only give noroviruses in the test tube, needs to be clarified in further studies.",unknown,"There are no studies that have investigated the effect of lemon juice on gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus. It is therefore unclear whether lemon juice is suitable for disinfection, prevention or treatment."
274,"For knee osteoarthritis, does rubbing DMSO into the knee bring less pain and more mobility than rubbing a placebo?","Apparently not In the two best-method studies with DMSO and a dummy preparation for comparison, no convincing efficacy was shown. Long-term studies on benefits and risks are missing In addition, our assessment shows that the studies were too short: they only lasted a few weeks, while the symptoms of osteoarthritis in the knee often persist for many years, sometimes even decades.",no,"Reliable studies have found no difference between DMSO and a placebo. However, there are still some uncertainties."
275,"In case of osteoarthritis of the knee, does rubbing DMSO bring less pain and more mobility than the recognized painkiller diclofenac???",The study comparing Diclofenac and DMSO did not provide reliable evidence of the equivalence of the two means.,unknown,"Reliable studies have found no difference between DMSO and a placebo. However, there are still some uncertainties."
276,Does taking vitamin D improve symptoms in the most common form of psoriasis?,"However, none of the studies could prove convincingly that vitamin D helps the participants better than a dummy medication. According to current knowledge, psoriasis symptoms do not improve if affected people take vitamin D. Omega-3 fatty acids: Many data, little benefit The data on fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids, on the other hand, looks quite impressive at first glance: 14 studies with around 700 participants [1, 4-7]. As good as placebo The results of this study, however, do not provide convincing evidence of the effectiveness of vitamin D, because there is no significant difference to the sham drug.",no,"Three smaller studies have found no benefit of vitamin D in psoriasis beyond that seen with placebo,The question has been investigated in many small studies, some with serious methodological flaws. The majority of studies have failed to find a benefit of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil in psoriasis compared to placebo."
277,Does taking fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids improve the symptoms of various forms of psoriasis more than a placebo???,"The majority of studies have found no benefit of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil in psoriasis compared to placebo. According to current knowledge, psoriasis symptoms do not improve if affected people take vitamin D. Omega-3 fatty acids: Many data, little benefit The data on fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids, on the other hand, looks quite impressive at first glance: 14 studies with around 700 participants [1, 4-7]. The current data therefore tend to argue against the effectiveness of fish oil.",no,"Three smaller studies have found no benefit of vitamin D in psoriasis beyond that seen with placebo,The question has been investigated in many small studies, some with serious methodological flaws. The majority of studies have failed to find a benefit of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil in psoriasis compared to placebo."
278,Does following a Mediterranean diet decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in people at high risk?,"Do doctors and doctors do well when they advise their patients to feed on Mediterranean food? They show that switching to a Mediterranean diet is probably useful for people with high cardiovascular risk. Five years later, in the Mediterranean diet group, significantly fewer heart attacks, strokes or cardiovascular deaths had occurred [1] : 36 out of 1000 participants from the Mediterranean diet group have been affected by one of the three serious cardiovascular diseases (with or without death) over the course of five years. So it seems that the Mediterranean diet can protect some people from serious cardiovascular diseases. Studies with myocardial infarction patients point to a benefit of the Mediterranean diet [2,3].",yes,"People who follow this traditional diet from the Mediterranean region are probably less likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke. However, the Mediterranean diet does not seem to prolong life.,According to a study with a small number of people, a Mediterranean diet could reduce the risk of fatal cardiovascular disease. However, further studies must first confirm this."
279,Does the probability of dying from cardiovascular disease decrease in people who have already had a heart attack?,"A transition to a Mediterranean diet is therefore likely to reduce the risk of having another heart attack within the next three to four years. After about 46 months, total deaths as well as deaths from cardiovascular diseases had occurred significantly less frequently in the group with the Mediterranean diet.",yes,"People who follow this traditional diet from the Mediterranean region are probably less likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke. However, the Mediterranean diet does not seem to prolong life.,According to a study with a small number of people, a Mediterranean diet could reduce the risk of fatal cardiovascular disease. However, further studies must first confirm this."
280,Does Grander water have health benefits compared to untreated drinking water?,"We could not find any studies on the health effects of Granderwasser. Whether the supposedly more living water actually â€“ as claimed â€“ has improved well-being or has other effects on health has never been investigated. So far, there is no convincing evidence that Granderwasser is at all different from normal water. The studies in detail No clinical studies found.",unknown,The alleged active principle of Grander Water is not scientifically plausible. There are also no clinical studies on the health effect to be found. Other studies usually find no difference between Grander water and untreated water.
281,"Does astaxanthin protect against cardiovascular disease, cancer or prolong life?","But they have not investigated whether astaxanthin actually has a positive effect on the life of the test subjects, for example: Is the course of certain diseases more favourable with astaxanthin? Unfortunately, such studies are missing for astaxanthin. The supposedly wonderful effects of astaxanthin as a dietary supplement are therefore not sufficiently investigated, let alone proven.",unknown,"There is a lack of meaningful studies on astaxanthin. There are only studies that have recorded certain blood values or other surrogate variables for cardiovascular diseases, which on top of that could not find any benefit for the pink dye."
282,Do products from the noni fruit promote health?,"Roughly speaking, based on the current study situation, we can neither confirm nor exclude positive effects by Noni. We couldn't find any serious clinical studies investigating the efficacy of Noni in high blood pressure or in the prevention and treatment of cancer. The studies in detail Study situation on extracts and juices from the Noni fruit is poor. Therefore, we do not know whether Noni has significant positive health effects â€“ even if the authors of animal and test glass studies like to suggest this.",unknown,"To date, there are no scientifically well-conducted studies that can prove a health benefit of noni."
283,Can spending time at waterfalls on a regular basis provide lasting improvement in asthma symptoms?,"Whether waterfalls have a positive effect on asthma is therefore unclear and needs to be researched better. In our view, the improvements reported for individual children are no evidence that waterfall therapy is generally effective in children with asthma.",unknown,"So far, only one study has examined this question. However, it cannot provide an answer; the deficiencies in implementation are too great."
284,Does goji help with serious diseases like cancer or prevent heart attacks?,"Many studies with Goji, but few evidence Due to the full-bodied advertising promises about Gojiberry, we have approached literature research with correspondingly high expectations. However, these studies have not investigated any meaningful parameters: For example, we searched in vain for information on whether Goji prevents a heart attack or stroke, or helps to avoid diabetes-related damage or a deterioration of vision by AMD. So whether Goji can provide real support for cancer, we consider this one clinical study to be quite doubtful.",unknown,"There are some smaller studies with different goji preparations on various health issues such as cancer, diabetes, strengthening of the immune system or age-related macular degeneration. However, no reliable statements about noticeable effects of the goji berry can be derived from them."
285,Are amla supplements effective and safe in lowering high cholesterol?,"However, there is no evidence of their efficacy. On this basis, it would not be serious to judge the effectiveness or even suggest positive effects. [5] It remains therefore open whether the intake of Amla food supplements on the one hand can make the laboratory values on the paper ""beautiful"" appear and on the other hand can actually cause a reduction in illness and death. Thus, it remains unclear whether Amla can contribute to the reduction of cholesterol and whether the berry ultimately leads to a noticeable improvement in health, i.e.",unknown,"There are some studies with human test subjects. But the list of flaws is long, and the results of the studies are therefore not trustworthy. Thus, dietary supplements with Amla are not an alternative for proven effective therapies."
286,"Does inhaling hive air have health benefits for asthma, allergies or other conditions?","Hot air Significant clinical studies on the effectiveness of bee air therapy appear to have never been performed. Without well-made investigations to the benefit, the promises and expectations about the therapy with air from hives lack a solid basis. The so far circulating anecdotes on the effectiveness of bee air do not give an answer to essential questions: How long do the collaged effects last after bee air therapy? However, it is not investigated whether this helps reliably â€“ theoretically, fractions of pollen grains could slip through the filter pores and yet be inhaled. As well as effectiveness, undesirable side effects of hive-air therapy are not investigated; and on this basis, serious statements about safety or safety are not investigated.",unknown,There is no scientific research that speaks for or against such a health effect.
287,Can chlorinated water from baby swimming cause asthma or allergies later in childhood?,"However, insufficient research is being carried out on whether babies exposed to chlorine in swimming water will develop asthma or allergies later in their childhood. However, the study cannot prove whether baby swimming was the cause of asthma.",unknown,Studies conducted to date are too inconclusive and contradictory to make concrete scientific statements.
288,Is a lot of sunlight in childhood and adolescence a cause of age-related macular degeneration?,"Whether a lot of sun in childhood and adolescence is a cause of macular degeneration in old age can only answer future, better conducted studies. All in all, the study cannot therefore answer whether children have a long-term increased risk of macular degeneration when they are much in the sun.",unknown,"Whether sunlight is (a) cause for age-related macular degeneration cannot be answered seriously at present. The quality of the existing studies is too poor. Regarding the question whether sunglasses in childhood reduce the risk for macular degeneration in old age, corresponding studies are missing."
289,Does wearing sunglasses in childhood and adolescence protect against macular degeneration in old age???,Whether wearing sunglasses in childhood protects against macular degeneration in old age has not been investigated in studies. It is also unclear for the later years of life whether sunglasses have a protective effect.,unknown,"Whether sunlight is (a) cause for age-related macular degeneration cannot be answered seriously at present. The quality of the existing studies is too poor. Regarding the question whether sunglasses in childhood reduce the risk for macular degeneration in old age, corresponding studies are missing."
290,Does water from jugs with semi-precious stones have a positive health effect?,"However, it is unlikely that health-relevant amounts from the ""healstones"" will pass into the water. Apparently, the research has not dealt with healing stones in the water nor investigated the health effects of this special drinking water. Benefits are not plausible Our conclusion, therefore, is that the benefits and risks of ""healstones"" in drinking water are not investigated. Any evidence from scientific medicine is missing for a positive health effect.",unknown,No studies are available on this. An effect is not plausible.
291,Is calcium from Japanese coral safe and effective in preventing disease?,"However, in our research on coral calcium, it was not surprising: we did not find any studies with test subjects that would have enabled us to make a serious assessment of this claim. Our conclusion: we cannot say whether coral calcium has a preventive benefit, so whether it is effective in the prevention of various diseases. In the absence of comparative studies, it has not been proven to what extent coral calcium has a different effect than â€˜normal' calcium, which we absorb with food or in the form of common dietary supplements.",unknown,There are no well-done studies with human subjects that have investigated the efficacy and safety of dietary supplements containing coral calcium.
292,Does the observance of feng shui design rules help against bad sleep?,Our Conclusion We could not find any studies that have dealt with the health effects of mirrors in the bedroom. We could not determine whether Feng Shui's design principles might have a beneficial effect on health and sleep. Feeling good through sleep hygiene We cannot judge the effects of a Feng Shui living culture on sleep quality.,unknown,Sleep hygiene recommends designing bedrooms so that their occupants feel comfortable. We were not able to find out whether designing the bedroom according to the rules of Feng Shui or leaving out mirrors opposite the bed plays a role in this. Corresponding studies are lacking.
293,Does taking vitamin C prevent motion sickness?,"On the basis of the study, we cannot draw reliable conclusions for seasickness in particular. Therefore, according to the current state of science, the question of whether vitamin C can prevent travel sickness cannot be answered.",unknown,We found only one small study with methodological flaws on this question. The study investigated a very specific question and shows contradictory results.
294,Do Lifewave patches improve health or athletic and mental performance?,"However, there is no credible scientific explanation for such effects. Based on these studies, it cannot be said whether the patches are beneficial. It never evaluated whether the patches could improve the health and performance of the participants.",unknown,"There are no trustworthy, comprehensibly conducted studies that suggest or even prove such an effect. The fact that the patches help is not plausible anyway."
295,Are there differences in hair removal effectiveness between IPL and diode laser?,"Possibly no difference Our general conclusion is: Previous studies indicate that there should be at least no clear differences between diode lasers and IPL, used by professionals. Both methods may have similar effects. The results of 23 remaining women suggest that both diode lasers and IPL are likely to be similarly effective with Hirsutism-induced hair on the face.",no,"There may be no difference between hair reduction with diode laser and IPL. We have only been able to evaluate three studies on the subject with a few female test subjects; the studies had various methodological deficiencies. Therefore, our judgment could be revised in the future by better done studies. Reliable data on the long-term effect of epilation with diode laser and light are lacking. The generalization of the preliminary results is also problematic, for example because the studies we used only investigated hair removal on the face and in the armpits."
296,Does carbonic acid cause cancer?,"Cancer by Carbonic Acid Little Probable We currently cannot judge for sure whether carbonated beverages affect health. After all, there is evidence that carbonic acid is not likely to be responsible for the development of cancer [1-4]. However, in the absence of evidence that carbon dioxide in combination with other ingredients causes cancer, it is unlikely that it will do so alone.",no,"Currently existing studies are too inconclusive to allow reliable conclusions to be drawn about the effect of carbonic acid on the digestive tract. However, there are indications that carbonic acid is unlikely to cause cancer. However, the underlying studies have only limited significance."
297,Does carbonic acid have any health effects on the digestive tract???,Effects on digestion unexplained It is difficult to assess whether sparkling drinks affect the digestive tract. What carbonic acid causes in the digestive tract cannot be concluded from its results.,unknown,"Currently existing studies are too inconclusive to allow reliable conclusions to be drawn about the effect of carbonic acid on the digestive tract. However, there are indications that carbonic acid is unlikely to cause cancer. However, the underlying studies have only limited significance."
298,Does wearing compression stockings on a long-haul flight prevent thrombosis (blood clots) and the associated symptoms?,"Preventing compression stockings is effective Compression stockings are designed to prevent thrombosis. And indeed: On a long-haul flight, wearing compression stockings reduces the likelihood that blood clots will form in the leg. Many thrombosis are prevented Furthermore, the results show that compression stockings prevent many thrombosis. The compression stockings were able to reduce the incidence of symptom-free thrombosis both in people at increased risk and in people not particularly at risk. It is therefore likely that compression stockings can also reduce the rare problematic thrombosis.",yes,"In previous studies, compression stockings have significantly reduced the likelihood of symptomless thrombosis. This probably also reduces the risk of rarely occurring problematic thromboses that lead to serious symptoms."
299,Can extracorporeal shock wave therapy relieve heel pain if the cause is tendonitis or a heel spur?,"Thus, shock wave therapy can probably relieve the pain of these sufferers, although not in any case [1]. Still unexplained Although the existing studies have clearly shown an advantage of shock wave therapy over sham treatment, some questions remain unanswered: How strong must the shock waves be in order to relieve the discomfort in the best possible way and still protect the sole of the foot? However, the evidence-based medical information center of Danube University Krems has found only weak indications that shock wave therapy can help in bone fractures: ""Is there evidence of the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in acute shaft fractures in support of fracture healing?",yes,"Shock wave therapy is likely to help relieve chronic heel pain - if it is caused by inflammation of the plantar tendon plate (plantar fasciitis) or by a heel spur. In many cases, the complaints also improve on their own."
300,Does an extract from the African black bean (active ingredient 5-hydroxytryptophan) help against lovesickness?,There is no scientific evidence that the preparation can actually relieve mental pain after separation from a beloved partner.,unknown,Such an effect has not yet been scientifically confirmed.
301,Does a mixture of hops and other natural remedies help with sleep problems?,"In combination with other ""natural"" means, hops seem to be able to do nothing to prevent sleep disorders. More research needed In total, three studies involving a total of 412 men and women indicate that different combination preparations with hops cannot improve sleep.",no,"As a single active ingredient, hops have not been well researched. Significant clinical studies exist only on mixed preparations containing the following agents in addition to hops: Valerian, unsaturated vegetable fats or processed milk protein in combination with an extract of Chinese date. Results of previous studies indicate that these mixtures cannot improve sleep."
302,Do hops as a single active ingredient help with sleep problems???,"For hops as a single active ingredient, the question of effectiveness is quickly answered: We have not found any clinical studies. So we cannot say whether hops alone improve sleep.",unknown,"As a single active ingredient, hops have not been well researched. Significant clinical studies exist only on mixed preparations containing the following agents in addition to hops: Valerian, unsaturated vegetable fats or processed milk protein in combination with an extract of Chinese date. Results of previous studies indicate that these mixtures cannot improve sleep."
303,Does taking a mushroom called reishi benefit cancer?,"Since all studies have more or less large methodological weaknesses, the results â€“ even if they are nominally in favour of Reishi â€“ are not meaningful. So, according to current knowledge, it is not certain whether Reishi will benefit from cancer. Although the response to therapy was studied in two studies, no benefit was found for Reishi compared to comparative therapy.",unknown,"The question of the effect of Reishi against cancer was explored in some studies. However, these were small and sometimes had serious methodological flaws. In addition, because a variety of cancers, treatments, and Reishi preparations have been studied, comparisons are difficult. Thus, the question of the anti-cancer effect of the mushroom cannot be answered reliably."
304,Can labor pain during childbirth be relieved by aromatherapy with lavender oil?,"The results of these studies suggest that the fragrance of the essential oil may slightly weaken the strength of the pain in labor. Women who received an aromatherapy with lavender oil estimated their pain on average between 0.4 and 1.6 points lower than those who received only a sham therapy without essential oil [1,2].",yes,"Previous studies are poorly done, so their results have limited confidence. They suggest that aromatherapy with lavender oil might slightly relieve labor pain. Whether aromatherapy also shortens the duration of labor is not clear."
305,Can the duration of childbirth be reduced by aromatherapy with lavender oil?,"Therefore, it is currently unclear whether lavender fragrance oil helps women to hold their newborn in their hands faster. However, it is not sufficiently researched whether aromatherapy can really make a difference here.",unknown,"Previous studies are poorly done, so their results have limited confidence. They suggest that aromatherapy with lavender oil might slightly relieve labor pain. Whether aromatherapy also shortens the duration of labor is not clear."
306,Does a patch with high-dose capsaicin relieve pain after shingles?,So the nerve pain improved for eight to twelve weeks: With the capsaicin patch for 36 out of 100 people. Efficacy in pain after shingles They were able to draw clear conclusions from two works involving 571 patients and patients suffering from nerve pain after shingles.,yes,"In some individuals who have survived shingles, a patch containing the high-dose active ingredient capsaicin (8%) is likely to relieve nerve pain (neuropathic pain) for about 12 weeks.,The studies available on this question are of poor quality and do not allow conclusions to be drawn. Thus, it is unclear whether high-dose capsaicin (8%) in patch form can relieve nerve pain in people with diabetes or HIV."
307,Does a patch with high-dose capsaicin relieve pain in diabetes mellitus or infection with HIV?,"It is therefore unclear whether high-dose capsaicin (8%) in patch form can relieve nerve pain in people with diabetes or HIV. Effect unclear in diabetes and HIV The research team has not been able to answer as clearly as possible whether a patch with capsaicin can help to control the nerve pain caused by HIV or diabetes [1]. For this reason, we consider the results of these studies to be unreliable and therefore cannot say whether capsaicin patches are effective against the nerve pain typical of HIV and diabetes.",unknown,"In some individuals who have survived shingles, a patch containing the high-dose active ingredient capsaicin (8%) is likely to relieve nerve pain (neuropathic pain) for about 12 weeks.,The studies available on this question are of poor quality and do not allow conclusions to be drawn. Thus, it is unclear whether high-dose capsaicin (8%) in patch form can relieve nerve pain in people with diabetes or HIV."
308,Does industrially highly processed food increase the risk of cancer?,"In the course of time, a certain pattern appeared: people with the highest consumption of ""industrial food"" developed cancer a little more frequently. This means that highly processed products may lead to a slight increase in the risk of cancer. These results therefore suggest that eating and drinking highly processed foods may easily favour the occurrence of cancer.",yes,"The first indications of a possible link between the consumption of industrially produced, highly processed products and cancer have emerged in a large French observational study. So it could be that people who eat and drink more highly processed products (e.g., convenience foods) are somewhat more likely to develop cancer. More long-term research on this important topic is definitely needed. Current knowledge is by no means well established, and reliable evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between highly processed food and cancer is lacking. The possible underlying mechanism is unknown."
309,Does propolis have a healing or soothing effect on inflammation in the mouth (in otherwise healthy people)?,"No evidence of anti-inflammatory effects The result of our research was disappointing. However, whether or not Propolis can act as a cure, the studies cannot answer due to their poor quality. It is therefore unclear whether differences between the group results at the end of the study are really due to the use of Propolis â€“ or are based only on the fundamental differences between the groups.",unknown,"Previous studies on aphthae, candidiasis and inflammation of the mouth in otherwise healthy people are poorly conducted. An assessment of the effect of propolis is not possible on this basis."
310,Do amalgam fillings affect the mental development of school children compared to plastic dental fillings?,"Although the study authors found slightly higher amounts of mercury in the body in children with amalgam fillings, the levels were well below the level of health concern [6, 14]. Overall, it is unlikely that amalgam fillings will affect the mental abilities of children. The amalgam did not seem to be the cause of the complaints, even if those persons who could remove the fillings had slightly lower mercury levels [4]. Amalgam had no negative effects on the intelligence, memory or concentration of the children.",no,"Children who receive at least one amalgam filling between the ages of six and ten have slightly more mercury in their bodies than their peers with plastic fillings. However, these levels are almost certainly too low to impair mental abilities such as intelligence, concentration and memory over a five-year period. This is what previous studies have shown. Little research has been done on the possible effects of amalgam fillings on children under the age of six and, in the case of pregnant women, on their unborn offspring. Whether there are other health effects has hardly been researched so far."
311,Does curcumin protect healthy people from mental impairment or even from developing dementia?,"Studies with turmeric lack of meaningfulness Impressive evidence for effectiveness or at least promising evidence we could not find in any study. In the studies on the prevention of dementia [1-3], the results were contradictory. Contradictory prevention results Two studies [1,2] found positive effects of turmeric only in some, but not in all tests. The only conclusion that can be drawn here on the subject of dementia prevention: contradictory.",unknown,"Three studies with relatively few test subjects and partly serious methodological deficiencies show contradictory results with questionable significance.,Two studies were unable to find any effect of a six-month treatment with curcumin. However, the studies were relatively small and had methodological problems."
312,Does curcumin protect people with already diagnosed dementia from further decline in mental abilities???,"In the studies in patients already suffering from dementia [4.5], turmeric had no more positive effects on memory performance than dummy medications.",no,"Three studies with relatively few test subjects and partly serious methodological deficiencies show contradictory results with questionable significance.,Two studies were unable to find any effect of a six-month treatment with curcumin. However, the studies were relatively small and had methodological problems."
313,Do preparations with humic acids help with diseases or complaints of the stomach and intestines?,"Alone: We have not been able to find meaningful scientific studies on whether humic acids contribute to the health or recovery of the stomach and intestine. No studies published In our research on the efficacy of humic acids, we only encountered some ""application observations"". And so it remains unclear whether the observed changes after the intake of humic acids are actually due to the product itself.",unknown,We could not identify any meaningful studies on this question
314,Does an extract from grapefruit seeds work against fungal diseases such as athlete's foot or nail fungus?,"However, it is not quite clear whether the extract itself was effective against the microorganisms. Therefore, no statements can be made as to whether extracts from grapefruit seeds actually help against fungal diseases in humans.",unknown,The efficacy of extracts from the seeds of grapefruit against fungi has been researched only in laboratory trials. The results were contradictory. The remedy was not tested at all on people with athlete's foot or nail fungus.
315,Does taking rosehip powder for rheumatoid arthritis improve symptoms?,"In rheumatoid arthritis, the only available study finds a computational advantage for rose hip powder.",no,"The question has only been investigated in one small study with methodological deficiencies. In this study, a calculated advantage was found for those people who were treated with rose hip powder. Compared to placebo, however, the advantage was so small that it is unlikely to bring about any noticeable improvement in everyday life.,A total of three smaller studies with methodological flaws have investigated the question, but have come to contradictory results."
316,Does taking rosehip powder for osteoarthritis alleviate the symptoms???,"The studies also generally had several methodological weaknesses, so the results are not reliable. No evidence of efficacy Not only the methods are disappointing. Whether rose hip powder is actually well tolerated can not be said for sure because of the small number of participants and because of the relatively short duration of study. The studies, however, yielded contradictory results: some found an advantage of rose hip powder, while others did not.",unknown,"The question has only been investigated in one small study with methodological deficiencies.

317,Can the genetic blood test for Down syndrome (trisomy 21) predict whether the unborn child is affected - in pregnant women at increased risk?,"Good risk assessment, but no diagnosis Our conclusion from studies with high-risk pregnancies: The genetic blood test probably detects almost all foetuses with resp. Not only Down's syndrome discovered The tests can not only determine whether the unborn is likely to have Down's syndrome (trisomy 21), but may also be affected by rarer genetic impairments.",yes,"In pregnant women with an abnormal preliminary result, the genetic blood test can probably predict with great accuracy whether the unborn child has Down syndrome (trisomy 21) or not. However, the test result is not always correct: in rare cases, the test ""misses"" Down syndrome, i.e. it is ""falsely inconspicuous"". It can also happen that the blood test predicts Down syndrome even though the fetus is not affected (""false-conspicuous"")."
318,"Do preparations with rose root have an effect against stress and its consequences, e.g. exhaustion?","For this reason, the present studies do not provide a reliable assessment of whether the roseroot actually has an effect on stress. According to EMA-Gremium, the effect of roseroot is not convincingly proven â€“ by the way, this applies not only to stress and exhaustion, but also to other areas of application such as physical performance, anxiety disorders or depression. The results were contradictory: three studies found an advantage of roseroot, but two did not.",unknown,"The effect of rose root has been investigated in several small studies. However, these studies were mostly of very poor quality, and they came to inconsistent results. Therefore, based on our current knowledge, we cannot make a definite statement. We do not know whether rose root is good as an anti-stress remedy - or ineffective."
319,Is microwave therapy effective and safe for long-term reduction of excessive sweating (primary hyperhidrosis) in adults?,"Efficacy poorly investigated We wanted to find out how well the new therapy with microwaves works against sweating, but unfortunately only one study [1] with good study design was able to find on the subject. According to Gravimetry measurements, there was no significant improvement in the long term due to microwave therapy. All in all, based on preliminary results, we cannot say whether microwave therapy is effective and safe in the long term in order to reduce sweat production.",unknown,"Treatment with microwaves has only recently been performed on patients with excessive sweating in the axillary region. Unfortunately, the current study situation does not provide conclusive information on the long-term efficacy and safety of this form of treatment."
320,Does ointment with comfrey help against back pain and knee pain better than a placebo?,"In case of back pain [1] and knee arthrosis [2] the plant extract obtained from legwell seems to help better than a sham medication (placebo). With the legwell ointment, the pain intensity decreased more than with placebo.",yes,"The effect of ointments with comfrey against pain in the back and knee has only been investigated in quite small studies with methodological problems. It is possible that comfrey is more effective than placebo; in the case of pain in the knee joint, the effect could even be clearly noticeable for those affected. Future studies should shed much more light on these possible effects.,In three small studies, the effect of comfrey on sore muscles or sprained ankle was compared with that of placebo and painkillers. However, the seemingly positive results are not reliable, and better studies are needed."
321,Does ointment with comfrey help with ankle sprains and sore muscles???,"Insufficiently proven Methodically even worse are the studies on the use of legwell in pain due to a sprained ankle [3,4] or muscle ache [5]. However, there are some ambiguities in the study publication, and it is only a single study with relatively few participants. However, it is not clear whether the difference was felt by the parties concerned. For these reasons, this study is not meaningful.",unknown,"The effect of ointments with comfrey against pain in the back and knee has only been investigated in quite small studies with methodological problems.

322,Can chlorhexidine in the form of dental varnish prevent the formation of caries in adults?,"However, chlorhexidine does not seem to protect adults at all or only to a very small extent from caries. In the summary of several studies [1] the researchers evaluated only the effects on root caries: it showed no or only a very small protective effect of chlorhexidine. The single study [2] looked at all types of caries and concluded that there was no anti-caries benefit at all. The authors of both survey work on the benefit of chlorhexidine in children and adolescents agreed: They considered the included studies to be untrustworthy due to methodological shortcomings â€“ but obviously there is no better one.",no,"A large well-done study with chlorhexidine dental varnish was unable to find an effect. The summary of several smaller studies with chlorhexidine varnish suggests that chlorhexidine dental varnishes may have a statistical effect, but no noticeable anti-caries effect for users. We did not find well-done studies on the benefits of chlorhexidine tooth gel and chlorhexidine mouth rinses for caries prevention. For children, no firm conclusions can be made about the benefit of chlorhexidine products for caries prevention."
323,"Can chlorhexidine in the form of mouth rinses and gels for home use in children and adults, and as a dental varnish in children, prevent the formation of caries?","Not enough data for children For the use of chlorhexidine products in children, the data situation is even worse than in adults. Therefore, for the benefit of chlorhexidine in children, we cannot make a sure statement. Therefore, the effect of chlorhexidine preparations in children cannot be classified from our point of view; we simply have too little sound knowledge.",unknown,"A large well-done study with chlorhexidine dental varnish was unable to find an effect.

For children, no firm conclusions can be made about the benefit of chlorhexidine products for caries prevention."
324,Does a legal smoking ban reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers?,"There are good studies on positive health effects for the population after the introduction of national smoking bans. Emergency cases go back After the introduction of the smoking bans, there was a decline in cardiovascular disease and in emergencies such as heart attack or stroke â€“ probably a result of the bans. According to the survey, there are also indications that fewer people died of smoke-related diseases as a result of a smoking ban. Smoking ban makes sense In summary, there are strong indications that the health of non-smokers is improved by laws for a nationwide smoking ban. The summarized results show that the population is likely to benefit from smoking bans, especially due to fewer cardiovascular problems.",yes,A legal smoking ban is likely to reduce the number of cardiovascular diseases and emergencies in the population as a whole. Mortality is also likely to decrease.
325,Do pregnant women who take vitamin D have a lower risk of preterm birth?,"Also in premature births or a too low growth of the unborn child, a lack of vitamin D in the mother is often recorded in parallel [1-3]. According to the summarized study results, it is likely that mothers will have less premature births due to the vitamin D preparations, i.e. Although some of the studies analysed indicated that taking vitamin D could reduce the risk of complications such as pregnancy poisoning and gestational diabetes or low birth weight of the baby.",yes,"Some studies with few participants suggest that taking vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of preterm birth. However, it seems to be just the opposite when pregnant women swallow vitamin D together with calcium. At least in one study, the risk of preterm birth increased in this case. The cause was not clear. Overall, many questions remain open; the study situation is not satisfactory enough to recommend vitamin D intake in principle for all pregnant women on this basis."
326,Do pregnant women who take vitamin D in combination with calcium have a lower risk of preterm birth?,"Vitamin D and calcium as a risky duo The indicated positive effect, which protects against premature births, turned to the contrary when the women swallowed vitamin D together with calcium. Paradoxically, those women who took not only vitamin D but also calcium more often had premature births.",no,"Some studies with few participants suggest that taking vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce the risk of preterm birth. However, it seems to be just the opposite when pregnant women swallow vitamin D together with calcium. At least in one study, the risk of preterm birth increased in this case.

327,Does aromatherapy have a calming effect on agitation and aggression typical of dementia?,"Apart from this exception (Lavendel-Aromatherapie), we do not know whether aromatherapy can help people with dementia [1] : Due to the current study situation, we cannot confirm or exclude efficacy. We cannot make reliable statements about the safety or possible side effects of aromatherapy in dementia, even in long-term use. However, we do not assume that aromatherapy has a very large, previously undiscovered positive effect on the symptoms and quality of life of dementia sufferers. Aromatherapy is intended to help against sleep disorders, depression or pain and is quite popular â€“ although the scientific evidence generally leaves much to be desired [1].",unknown,"Based on the state of studies, it is largely unclear whether aromatherapy can help patients with dementia. There are quite a few studies on the subject, but many of them have gross flaws and are therefore not comparable. For example, studies with lemon balm aromatherapy have contradictory results. With lavender aromatherapy, on the other hand, a certain tendency has emerged: it does not seem to help against agitation and aggression - both typical accompanying symptoms of dementia."
328,Does aromatherapy have other positive effects for dementia patients???,"Apart from this exception (Lavendel-Aromatherapie), we do not know whether aromatherapy can help people with dementia [1] : Due to the current study situation, we cannot confirm or exclude efficacy.

329,Does tomato extract reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"Among the studies, however, there are no studies in which the protective effect has actually been checked against heart attack or stroke. Whether such effects also appear in the body and then actually prevent heart attack or stroke is unclear. However, the studies were poorly done. On this basis, we cannot reliably estimate the benefits.",unknown,"So far, there are only small and short studies with quite a few shortcomings. The influence of various tomato extracts on blood pressure was tested. It was not tested whether the tomato extracts reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke."
330,Does quitting smoking prolong life?,"Because people who no longer smoke are less likely to suffer from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, infections, respiratory diseases, diabetes and osteoporosis [9]. The advantages of a smoke stop apply not only to younger people, but also to older people aged 60 and over: They can probably regain years of life. Confirmation of previous results These studies are on a line with the results of well done studies [2-6.12], according to which it brings advantages at all ages to get rid of smoking. The sooner the stop succeeds, the more the risk of one of the many diseases caused or at least favoured by smoking decreases. In the case of former smokers, it was noticed that the higher risk of death continued to decrease with the years since the smoke was stopped.",yes,"Quitting smoking is likely to reduce the risk of premature death. This is probably also true for older people over 60, and the earlier smoking is stopped, the better it is. Because then the life expectancy of ex-smokers probably approaches that of non-smokers."
331,Does eating eggs increase the risk of cardiovascular disease?,"They indicate that in healthy people the consumption of eggs â€“ at least within the limits of up to five pieces per week â€“ does not favour the development of cardiovascular disease [1,2]. In moderate quantities â€“ up to five pieces per week â€“ chicken eggs should not be harmful to heart health as part of a balanced diet. The scientists found that one egg per day should not increase the risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. They concluded that an egg per day does not increase the risk of stroke or coronary heart disease in healthy people.",no,"In healthy adults, the risk of cardiovascular disease is not likely to increase if they consume up to five chicken eggs per week as part of a balanced diet. However, for some groups of people (e.g. diabetics), restrictions could be useful."
332,"Does oseltamivir (brand name ""Tamiflu"") reduce the severity and duration of influenza in otherwise healthy adults?",Disease a little shorter The anti-flu tablets could shorten the duration of the flu a little: Children and adults who are otherwise healthy suffer â€“ without Tamiflu â€“ on average seven days from the flu. With Tamiflu these adults would be about 17 hours earlier free of symptoms; children would gain in about 24 hours [3].,yes,"Oseltamivir could reduce the duration of influenza (""real flu"") by about half a day in otherwise healthy adults. It has not been proven that complications can be prevented by Tamiflu. Whether influenza patients are less contagious due to Tamiflu is unclear."
333,"Is active surveillance (""active surveillance"") of patients with low-risk prostate cancer associated with increased prostate cancer mortality risk in the long term?","Death risk is unclear For all causes of death combined, the ProtecT study indicates that prostate cancer patients with Active Surveillance die as late as those low-risk patients who are treated intensively with radiation or surgery from the outset. However, it is unclear whether the risk of prostate cancer in particular is significantly different for active-surveillance, surgical and irradiation groups â€“ as far as one of the results of the ProtecT study was quite good, but not perfect methodically. But more knowledge is needed about the long-term consequences of Active Surveillance (and other methods) in terms of quality of life and risk of death.",unknown,"Relatively good evidence shows that men with low-risk prostate cancer who are regularly monitored under active surveillance and receive treatment only when necessary are less likely to suffer from incontinence and impotence than patients who have undergone surgery or radiation. However, those on active surveillance may develop tumors more often and may be more likely to develop metastases. Whether men on active surveillance may be more likely to die from prostate cancer than immediately treated prostate cancer patients is insufficiently studied. However, study results suggest that there is no serious difference in life expectancy between the two strategies."
334,"Does Active Surveillance reduce the likelihood of becoming impotent or incontinence, i.e. unintentional urine leakage ??","Finally, these procedures often bring with them feared side effects, which can affect life in a lasting way: impotence and incontinence. Unfortunately, the long-term side effects of surgery and irradiation are often serious: irradiation in around 5 out of 10 men leads to impotence, after operations up to 7 out of 10 men are temporarily or permanently impotent.",yes,"Relatively good evidence shows that men with low-risk prostate cancer who are regularly monitored under active surveillance and receive treatment only when necessary are less likely to suffer from incontinence and impotence than patients who have undergone surgery or radiation.

335,Do extracts of prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) help with hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption?,"Effect unproven These prospects may sound tempting to party tigers, but the promises are not scientifically proven. Whether the fruits can help escape the hangover after excessive alcohol consumption therefore remains unexplained [2]. Whether alleged anti-catching agents can actually help to avoid a humping skull the next day is scientifically only poorly researched.",unknown,"To date, there have been few studies investigating efficacy of prickly pear extracts after alcohol consumption."
336,Do statins help older people suffering from cardiovascular disease to live longer? Do they reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke?,"However, it is also possible to make a number of clear statements: In patients already ill, statins are likely to prevent their health from deteriorating further â€“ even if they are over 65. And they live longer than people with similar health conditions who do not take statins [3]. In this risk situation, the use of statins is intended to prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases that may have serious consequences. 105 out of 1000 patients suffer from a non-fatal heart attack, 26 of which could be prevented by statin intake.",yes,"People with cardiovascular disease who do not take a statin die earlier. Without statins, heart attacks and strokes are also more likely to occur. This has not been studied in people aged 75 and older who do not yet have any pronounced cardiovascular disease, but only risk factors. It is therefore unclear whether they benefit from starting statin treatment."
337,Are statins useful in preventing cardiovascular disease in people 75 years and older???,"Hardly any studies with older people Unfortunately, so far only a few researchers have specifically addressed the question of whether statins protect older people as well as younger ones. There is no reliable data for people aged 75 and over. Therefore, we cannot make statements about the efficacy and safety of statins for people with cardiovascular risk above 75. In none of the individual studies that included older people, the researchers found a statistical indication that older people may benefit less (or more) from statins than younger people.",unknown,"People with cardiovascular disease who do not take a statin die earlier. Without statins, heart attacks and strokes are also more likely to occur.

338,"Is Traumeel gel or ointment effective for sports injuries such as sprains, bruises and strains?","The fact that Traumeeel gel can help with a sprained ankle is therefore not documented. Whether Traumeeel ointment or gel helps with typical sports injuries, only future better conducted studies can clarify. Whether a suitable and sufficiently dosed mixture of plant substances is actually present in Traumeel in order to be able to help with sports injuries, however, should only be clarified in well done, sufficiently large studies. It is therefore unclear whether Traumeeel gel can effectively relieve pain in ankle sprains.",unknown,The studies conducted so far are not sufficient to confirm the effectiveness of Traumeel in sports injuries.
339,Are weather phenomena and weather changes triggers of migraine attacks?,"Weather changes have no or only a small effect on whether migraines occur and how long the attacks last. However, the study also has some weaknesses that somewhat reduce its significance: very few people participated, and it is unclear to what extent its results are transferable to the general public of those affected by migraine. On the basis of the current study situation, we cannot say whether and how the weather affects migraine. The researchers could not find a clear connection with the different weather events.",unknown,"In sum, the topic is still not well researched. This could be due to the difficulty of providing evidence for what may be a very individual phenomenon."
340,Does artichoke preparation help with gastrointestinal problems?,"However, the quality and methodological shortcomings of these studies do not allow reliable information. Scientific work cannot provide sound evidence of effectiveness. Study results unfortunately not resilient Such findings may sound quite promising for people with digestive problems or irritable bowel syndrome, but the studies mentioned are not meaningful.",unknown,"There are some studies on the subject. However, the quality of these studies is very poor. There is a lack of solid evidence for the positive results, for example because the subjects were not blinded or compared with control groups. The role played by pharmaceutical companies in financing and conducting the studies also points to possible bias effects."
341,Does prickly pear help with long-term weight loss?,"Small to no effects The current study [1] shows that cactus fig preparations are apparently not suitable to lose weight. Since most of the available studies cover only periods from a few weeks to months, it is unclear what positive or negative effects the intake of cactus fig food supplements may have. Knowledge about permanent application missing All in all, cactus fig food supplements therefore do not seem to be suitable as a weight loss remedy. Whether cactus figs taken over a longer period of time are effective and safe remains unclear.",unknown,"Based on the study situation, it is unclear whether dietary supplements with prickly pear are supportive in losing weight over a long period of time. They probably do not help to reduce weight in the short term. It is possible that they can help to reduce the body fat percentage and BMI a little. But these effects are small - and probably have little or no impact on the individual. Reliable long-term studies on possible positive effects are lacking. In addition, it is uncertain what undesirable and possibly dangerous side effects may occur as a result of long-term use of prickly pear supplements."
342,Can turmeric relieve the symptoms of depression?,"However, the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of turmeric in depression is poor. There is currently only speculation about the way in which turmeric could have a positive effect on depression. Based on clinical studies conducted so far in humans, we cannot say whether turmeric can actually alleviate the symptoms of depression.",unknown,It is unclear whether turmeric can help with depression. The studies on this question that do exist are only of modest quality.
343,Do phthalates affect semen quality in men?,"Plasticizers and seed quality According to previous studies, the amount of individual phthalates in the body of men could be sufficient to affect the quality of their sperm cells [1-6]. The study results showed that the seeds of men were particularly often of low quality when men had high levels of phthalates in the body. The studies in detail Animal studies provide clear indications that some phthalates can promote infertility [12]. It found that the quality of sperm from participants with high phthalate values was on average lower.",yes,"In animal studies, some phthalates may promote infertility. Previous research in men suggests that levels of phthalates found in everyday life may reduce the quality of sperm cells in humans. This association is not well established, and it is unclear to what extent it affects fertility. Whether the plasticizers prevent women from becoming pregnant has not yet been investigated in meaningful studies."
344,Do phthalates reduce the likelihood of pregnancy in women?,"However, measurement problems and a number of missing data ensured that the results of this study were not reliable. Whether women have greater difficulty in becoming pregnant through phthalates can only be proven by more rigorous studies carried out in a larger number of female participants. However, the study does not reliably identify whether women with high phthalate levels have had major problems becoming pregnant.",unknown,"In animal studies, some phthalates may promote infertility. Previous research in men suggests that levels of phthalates found in everyday life may reduce the quality of sperm cells in humans.

345,Does ginseng improve mental performance in healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's dementia?,"Thus, there are no meaningful studies in which researchers investigated the effect of ginseng on Alzheimer's patients. [1] [2] Whether Ginseng can be a hope for dementia sufferers remains unexplained. Whether and how well such agents actually affect our mental capacity must examine more rigorous clinical studies with greater significance. Therefore, the five studies cannot answer the extent to which ginseng sharpens concentration and mind. Whether ginseng can improve mental performance in Alzheimer's patients is completely unclear.",unknown,Studies published so far are too untrustworthy to be able to prove such an effect of ginseng.
346,Does leaky gut syndrome cause health complaints or diseases?,"In scientific medicine, the term Leaky Gut Syndrome is unknown, even in medical literature databases, almost no publications can be found. So no one can describe exactly what Leaky Gut Syndrome is, but explanations remain vague. No indication of cause of disease As far as the causes of the mentioned intestinal diseases are concerned, science is still largely in the dark. Accordingly, the treatment of unscientifically proven ""diagnosis"" Leaky Gut syndrome is questionable. However, it is not possible to check whether these measures can fix the supposed Leaky Gut syndrome, since it is not clear how this syndrome can be detected at all.",unknown,"There is no clear definition of what leaky gut syndrome is. In fact, the intestinal mucosa is more permeable than usual in some diseases. However, it is unclear whether this is a cause or the consequence of the respective disease."
347,Does the Alexander Technique help with back pain and neck pain?,"Thus, exercises in Alexander's technique may significantly alleviate persistent back pain [1-3]. Facilitation by Alexander technique One year after the start of the study, the subjects had back pain on different days: on 21 out of 28 days, if they had only followed general medical advice on 3 out of 28 days, if they had a total of 24 weekly exercise units in Alexander technique behind them on 10 out of 28 days, if they had a total of 6 weekly exercise units in Alexander technique and additional exercise exercises behind them, however, these results are not well protected and need to be confirmed in further studies. Neck pain: little improvement Perhaps the Alexander technique also helps a little with neck pain. After a year, the neck pain in the Alexander-Technik group seemed to have improved a little [5]. Perhaps the Alexander technique led to less days of pain, but the pain itself was only slightly weaker than those in the comparison group.",yes,"Previous studies suggest that the Alexander Technique may help with long-lasting pain in the back and neck. However, further studies need to confirm this. For neck pain, the improvement does not seem to be very great."
348,Do the components of the Moringa oleifera tree have a positive effect on health?,"No evidence Even though the traditions of the numerous advantages of the plant go back to ancient times [2], the scientific evidence for the actual efficacy of Moringa preparations is very poor. Although there are some animal studies on the potential effects of Moringa, they do not allow for any conclusions on efficacy in humans. Whether Moringa extract actually improves health is unclear. Thus, it remains unclear whether Moringa powder actually has an effect on blood sugar levels.",unknown,"No well-conducted studies can be found that demonstrate any health benefits from extracts of the Moringa tree. Also, possible side effects of the plant preparations and any health effects during pregnancy and lactation are not well studied."
349,"Does an extract from the root of the Cape geranium (Pelargonium sidoides, Umckaloabo) work against bronchitis?","Overall, the results of previous studies give cautious evidence that Pelargonium drops could cause bronchitis (and the associated cough) to disappear faster [1,2]. The summarized results of the six bronchitis studies showed that those children and adults who swallowed the herbal extract got rid of their typical bronchitis symptoms (cough, ejection) faster than those subjects who took an active-free sham medication (placebo). In this work, too, the trend was that the extract of the Cape Pelargonia could potentially improve coughing.",yes,There is evidence of a possible effect in bronchitis. The effectiveness for colds or sinusitis has hardly been researched in reliable studies. It is therefore still an open question whether substances from Cape pelargonium can favorably influence colds and sinusitis.
