## ‚öì Pipeline
![pipeline](./figure/CrossRefinePipeline.png)
Cross-Refine has the following pipeline as shown in the figure:
1. The `generator` outputs an initial explanation based on the given input (`experiments/generator_explanation.py`)
   1. The explanation will be judged by LLMs whether it needs to be improved further (`experiments/generator_explanation_evaluation.py`)
2. The `critic` takes the initial explanation and input into account and outputs feedback on the explanation generated by `generator` & suggested explanation (`critic_feedback_explanation_generation.py`)
3. The `generator` gets feedback and suggested explanation from `critic` and use them to refine the initial explanation (`feedback_refinement.py`)

## ‚öôÔ∏èInstall the requirements
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example
Here is an example for an instance from ECQA dataset:
